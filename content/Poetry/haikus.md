Summary: 

### 12.25.15   
chinese restaurant  
rendezvous where teacups clink  
where christmas cash flows  

### 12.20.15  
water window smears  
from faulty windshield wipers  
induce drowsiness  

### 12.19.15  
a pattern to match  
a module to be loaded  
lazy functioning  

### 12.18.15  
sonorous resonations   
of adam driver's sith voice  
resound in my ears  

### 12.17.15  
finally finished  
the unabridged journals of  
sylvia plath yay  

### 12.16.15  
high school soccer game  
fifa disconnect explains  
lack of lob passes  

### 12.15.15  
yo barnes & nobles  
why you ain't got no dang books  
gift card coercion  

### 12.14.15  
the episode ends  
credits roll to exit song  
next button beckons  

### 12.13.15  
sylvia and chill  
innumerable entries  
sinusoidal mood  

### 12.12.15  
familiar drive home  
loud wind buffets blue chassis  
cows smell, music plays

fun beams from sun gleam  

### 12.08.15  
crock pot the pot's hot  
passively cooking meal in  
ceramic stoneware  

### 12.07.15  
year's end music plays  
scroll through interminable   
spotify rainbow  

### 12.06.15  
free will red pill the  
blonde girl lies prone, windowsill,  
blame the architect  

### 12.05.15  
are you inside out  
just ask the superquadric  
trace the ray till dawn  

### 12.04.15  
early morning buzz  
phone call disturbing slumber  
groggy roll to floor  

### 12.03.15 
my life in haiku  
why do i do what i do  
why do cows go moo
