Summary: 

### 01.12.16   
roman candlelight  
test tubes on sandy death row  
acid executes  

### 01.11.16   
jambalaya pot  
bottom burnt cancer stewing  
exudes toxic fumes  

### 01.09.16  
mason jar ice tea  
kinda makes it look like pee  
i drink anyways  

### 01.07.16  
sandwich thief at broad  
making me wait forever  
apologetic  

### 01.06.16  
heater dries the rain  
soaked into wrinkled pages  
dry the rain on me  

### 01.04.16  
sessions back in class  
free time hangs, fragile larvae  
to release havoc  

### 01.01.16  
monopolies reign  
advance to jedi council  
rotten luck sure sucks   

### 12.30.15  
a book in the bag  
aside compact disc in case  
daily treasures held  

### 12.29.15    
countless books to read  
new, or old and beloved  
desires exceed  

### 12.26.15   
blanket shields cold  
traps inside radiant heat  
subdues wakefulness  

### 12.25.15   
chinese restaurant  
rendezvous where teacups clink  
where christmas cash flows  

### 12.20.15  
water window smears  
from faulty windshield wipers  
induce drowsiness  

### 12.19.15  
a pattern to match  
a module to be loaded  
lazy functioning  

### 12.18.15  
sonorous resonations   
of adam driver's sith voice  
resound in my ears  

### 12.17.15  
finally finished  
the unabridged journals of  
sylvia plath yay  

### 12.16.15  
high school soccer game  
fifa disconnect explains  
lack of lob passes  

### 12.15.15  
yo barnes & nobles  
why you ain't got no dang books  
gift card coercion  

### 12.14.15  
the episode ends  
credits roll to exit song  
next button beckons  

### 12.13.15  
sylvia and chill  
innumerable entries  
sinusoidal mood  

### 12.12.15  
familiar drive home  
loud wind buffets blue chassis  
cows smell, music plays  

### 12.11.15  
finals done squad brunch  
christmas shopping paper source  
fight club spliced durden  

### 12.10.15  
where are all the youths  
drive to old pasadena  
crowded traffic jam

aardvark bucket hat  
forty year old fisherman  
fun beams from sun gleam  

### 12.08.15  
crock pot the pot's hot  
passively cooking meal in  
ceramic stoneware  

### 12.07.15  
year's end music plays  
scroll through interminable   
spotify rainbow  

### 12.06.15  
free will red pill the  
blonde girl lies prone, windowsill,  
blame the architect  

### 12.05.15  
are you inside out  
just ask the superquadric  
trace the ray till dawn  

### 12.04.15  
early morning buzz  
phone call disturbing slumber  
groggy roll to floor  

### 12.03.15 
my life in haiku  
why do i do what i do  
why do cows go moo
