Summary: 

### 02.04.16   
forget old, learn new,  
dumb wheel spinning round in place  
gaining time, not brains  

### 02.03.16   
write tired edit tired  
wake up tired go to sleep tired  
nap and feel more tired  

### 02.02.16   
optimistic plans:  
a rushed breakfast, quick shower,  
and slight tardiness  

### 02.01.16   
if talking was as  
thought out as texting, i would  
never talk again   

### 01.31.16   
priorities change;  
frozen thin mints; flashing lines;  
mind goes numb with null  

### 01.30.16   
writer's block is just  
sporadic youtube watching,  
fleeing apathy  

### 01.29.16   
the sixth extinction  
will kill off buttloads of bugs  
i'll give it my code  

### 01.28.16  
words roll off your tongue  
as rain rolls down my windows  
filling stifled air  

### 01.27.16   
breakfast and a quiz  
bagel and bleary answers  
mind schmears on blank page  

### 01.25.16   
freestyle singing to  
the same sad set of chords, turn  
shallow thoughts inwards   

### 01.24.16   
multiple alarms  
yet no roommate in gray view  
morning in peril  

### 01.23.16   
surrounded by gray   
grandparents, leaning in towards  
chambers of music  

### 01.22.16   
sometimes I forget  
how to interact with you  
clumsy interview  

### 01.21.16   
i want to pass out   
by that i mean go to sleep   
and dream of real life   

### 01.19.16  
interrupted sleep  
details segmented dream state  
trigger the handler  

### 01.18.16  
our coding skills suck  
operating systems muck  
eat butter chicken  

### 01.17.16   
bare necessity  
breathe through life's suffocations  
chem lab will soon pass  

### 01.16.16   
just yesterday the   
sand was molten lava, jump!   
now we're proposing  

### 01.15.16  
cliff edge roaring sea  
below, hungry sharks rearing  
jump in anyways  

### 01.14.16   
san pietro pres  
caltech, land of exceptions  
yes we are both matt  

### 01.13.16   
iffy idea   
implement a command shell   
set it to default  

### 01.12.16   
roman candlelight  
test tubes on sandy death row  
acid executes  

### 01.11.16   
jambalaya pot  
bottom burnt cancer stewing  
exudes toxic fumes  

### 01.09.16  
mason jar ice tea  
kinda makes it look like pee  
i drink anyways  

### 01.07.16  
sandwich thief at broad  
making me wait forever  
apologetic  

### 01.06.16  
heater dries the rain  
soaked into wrinkled pages  
dry the rain on me  

### 01.04.16  
sessions back in class  
free time hangs, fragile larvae  
to release havoc  

### 01.01.16  
monopolies reign  
advance to jedi council  
rotten luck sure sucks   

### 12.30.15  
a book in the bag  
aside compact disc in case  
daily treasures held  

### 12.29.15    
countless books to read  
new, or old and beloved  
desires exceed  

### 12.26.15   
blanket shields cold  
traps inside radiant heat  
subdues wakefulness  

### 12.25.15   
chinese restaurant  
rendezvous where teacups clink  
where christmas cash flows  

### 12.20.15  
water window smears  
from faulty windshield wipers  
induce drowsiness  

### 12.19.15  
a pattern to match  
a module to be loaded  
lazy functioning  

### 12.18.15  
sonorous resonations   
of adam driver's sith voice  
resound in my ears  

### 12.17.15  
finally finished  
the unabridged journals of  
sylvia plath yay  

### 12.16.15  
high school soccer game  
fifa disconnect explains  
lack of lob passes  

### 12.15.15  
yo barnes & nobles  
why you ain't got no dang books  
gift card coercion  

### 12.14.15  
the episode ends  
credits roll to exit song  
next button beckons  

### 12.13.15  
sylvia and chill  
innumerable entries  
sinusoidal mood  

### 12.12.15  
familiar drive home  
loud wind buffets blue chassis  
cows smell, music plays  

### 12.11.15  
finals done squad brunch  
christmas shopping paper source  
fight club spliced durden  

### 12.10.15  
where are all the youths  
drive to old pasadena  
crowded traffic jam  

### 12.09.15  
aardvark bucket hat  
forty year old fisherman  
fun beams from sun gleam  

### 12.08.15  
crock pot the pot's hot  
passively cooking meal in  
ceramic stoneware  

### 12.07.15  
year's end music plays  
scroll through interminable   
spotify rainbow  

### 12.06.15  
free will red pill the  
blonde girl lies prone, windowsill,  
blame the architect  

### 12.05.15  
are you inside out  
just ask the superquadric  
trace the ray till dawn  

### 12.04.15  
early morning buzz  
phone call disturbing slumber  
groggy roll to floor  

### 12.03.15 
my life in haiku  
why do i do what i do  
why do cows go moo
