<strong>your distinguishing feature(s)</strong>  <br/>
if asked to paint you i think i could   <br/>
not that i’m an artist  <br/>
not that it would look good  <br/>
or anything like you  <br/>
maybe the colors would be right  <br/>
the headband and ponytail  <br/>
at least  <br/>
some  <br/>
of what is floating and swirling around in  <br/>
there might make it  <br/>
a confession  <br/>
i’ve never been much for translation  <br/>
those latin words always fooled me  <br/>
an inverted ordering and unusual conjugation  <br/>
could throw off the keenest eye  <br/>
now  <br/>
tasked with putting images on paper  <br/>
or turning feelings into words  <br/>
let’s pretend that doodle is imaginary  <br/>
one second while i adopt intermission smiles and  <br/>
arboreal debris is awfully fascinating  <br/>
still  <br/>
i saw you yesterday (was it last night?)  <br/>
sitting next to her  <br/>
another one   <br/>
but which is which  <br/>
faces mutate while we take pictures  <br/>
to show friends how a dominant feature  <br/>
can do just that as a young face  <br/>
becomes a baby and   <br/>
everyone starts crying  <br/>
to see how i see you is not necessarily  <br/>
what i wanted to see  <br/>
not that i have any control  <br/>
not that this affects anyone’s reality  <br/>
