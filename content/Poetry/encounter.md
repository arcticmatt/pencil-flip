Summary: 

<span style="font-family:Cantarell">
**encounter**  
a single exchange  
or maybe a few  
a swapping of words and ideas  
and of views  
there're the usual questions  
cliche at best  
tired and old  
they still pass the test  
of prompting glazed eyes  
and should be condemned  
for conversational murder  
among many decent men  
or perhaps if you're lucky  
these niceties are passed  
you move straight to the heart  
with these questions asked  
what's your favorite record?  
or your favorite band?  
if you could live anywhere  
would it be in the sand?  
or maybe you ask something  
zany and stupid  
with both fingers crossed  
and while praying to cupid  
the arrows are fired  
the guns are unloaded  
you sit back and wait as  
the show starts unfolding  
you sit back and wait as  
the answers start rolling  
and the words you relate to  
are abundantly showing  
that this might be the start  
of no ordinary pairing  
it's not apples and oranges  
more like pickles and herring  
with these thoughts in your mind  
you depart with a smile  
give a pat on your back  
you could run a whole mile  
and then later that week  
you pass by that old friend  
or maybe acquaintance  
it's not really clear then  
relationship aside  
your eyes happen to meet  
exhibit no recognition of that  
fact and look away
