<strong>encounter</strong>  <br/>
a single exchange  <br/>
or maybe a few  <br/>
a swapping of words and ideas  <br/>
and of views  <br/>
there're the usual questions  <br/>
cliche at best  <br/>
tired and old  <br/>
they still pass the test  <br/>
of prompting glazed eyes  <br/>
and should be condemned  <br/>
for conversational murder  <br/>
among many decent men  <br/>
or perhaps if you're lucky  <br/>
these niceties are passed  <br/>
you move straight to the heart  <br/>
with these questions asked  <br/>
what's your favorite record?  <br/>
or your favorite band?  <br/>
if you could live anywhere  <br/>
would it be in the sand?  <br/>
or maybe you ask something  <br/>
zany and stupid  <br/>
with both fingers crossed  <br/>
and while praying to cupid  <br/>
the arrows are fired  <br/>
the guns are unloaded  <br/>
you sit back and wait as  <br/>
the show starts unfolding  <br/>
you sit back and wait as  <br/>
the answers start rolling  <br/>
and the words you relate to  <br/>
are abundantly showing  <br/>
that this might be the start  <br/>
of no ordinary pairing  <br/>
it's not apples and oranges  <br/>
more like pickles and herring  <br/>
with these thoughts in your mind  <br/>
you depart with a smile  <br/>
give a pat on your back  <br/>
you could run a whole mile  <br/>
and then later that week  <br/>
you pass by that old friend  <br/>
or maybe acquaintance  <br/>
it's not really clear then  <br/>
relationship aside  <br/>
your eyes happen to meet  <br/>
exhibit no recognition of that  <br/>
fact and look away  <br/>
