**Words of Advice**  
Words flow from the mouth of a gregarious friend  
towards the ears of a sagging man.  
This rough river runs with intentions to save,  
to uplift a sunken mass from the stony bed on which he lies.  
Like any drug, there can be unintended side effects:  
drowning, for one.

<span style="font-family:Georgia">
Inevitably, a river becomes an ocean. A spill becomes  
vast, beyond vision. The beach is meant for play,  
but this void does not harbor such good will. Wave  
after wave crashes on the dark surface as flecks of white  
foam get flung to the sides. Moment after moment, a continuous  
rise and fall.

To one man's eyes, these waters are refreshing: a cool dose  
of reality. From the view of another, they submerge all  
surroundings in an icy stasis. It's hard to breathe underwater.  
But the former would not go for a swim himself. He is content  
to sit by the shore, gazing at those who drown under the  
weight of his words.
