<strong>Words of Advice</strong>  </br>
Words flow from the mouth of a gregarious friend  </br>
towards the ears of a sagging man.  </br>
This rough river runs with intentions to save,  </br>
to uplift a sunken mass from the stony bed on which he lies.  </br>
Like any drug, there can be unintended side effects:  </br>
drowning, for one.  </br>

Inevitably, a river becomes an ocean. A spill becomes  </br>
vast, beyond vision. The beach is meant for play,  </br>
but this void does not harbor such good will. Wave  </br>
after wave crashes on the dark surface as flecks of white  </br>
foam get flung to the sides. Moment after moment, a continuous  </br>
rise and fall.  </br>

To one man's eyes, these waters are refreshing: a cool dose  </br>
of reality. From the view of another, they submerge all  </br>
surroundings in an icy stasis. It's hard to breathe underwater.  </br>
But the former would not go for a swim himself. He is content  </br>
to sit by the shore, gazing at those who drown under the  </br>
weight of his words.  </br>
