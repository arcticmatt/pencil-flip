**your distinguishing feature(s)**  
if asked to paint you i think i could   
not that i’m an artist  
not that it would look good  
or anything like you  
maybe the colors would be right  
the headband and ponytail  
at least  
some  
of what is floating and swirling around in  
there might make it  
a confession  
i’ve never been much for translation  
those latin words always fooled me  
an inverted ordering and unusual conjugation  
could throw off the keenest eye  
now  
tasked with putting images on paper  
or turning feelings into words  
let’s pretend that doodle is imaginary  
one second while i adopt intermission smiles and  
arboreal debris is awfully fascinating  
still  
i saw you yesterday (was it last night?)  
sitting next to her  
another one   
but which is which  
faces mutate while we take pictures  
to show friends how a dominant feature  
can do just that as a young face  
becomes a baby and   
everyone starts crying  
to see how i see you is not necessarily  
what i wanted to see  
not that i have any control  
not that this affects anyone’s reality
