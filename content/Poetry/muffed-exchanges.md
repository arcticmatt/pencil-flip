<span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size: 85%">
**muffed exchanges with well-intentioned people**  
sitting at a table with  
impulsive substances discussing  
tangential topics and laughing   
intermittently  
mason jar lightbulbs are  
aesthetic and useless  
the daylight is enough  
to stare into her eyes  
to watch them blink  
blink&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blink  
stare  
staring contest  
the key is not to blink  
good taste is key but   
i wish i got what she got   
old enough to know that looks aren’t  
everything  
but if that hair were shorter  
would my heart still race  
think back   
or remember strangely to   
find that all those friends  
are losers  
at least i’ve moulted conscious  
enough to name that cover and   
cough with restraint while fumbling over  
lost names and wasted food   
a slow exit and mechanical thanks is  
all i can muster but you are welcome   
for putting this china  
away
