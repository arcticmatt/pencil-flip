<strong>muffed exchanges with well-intentioned people</strong>  </br>
sitting at a table with  </br>
impulsive substances discussing  </br>
tangential topics and laughing   </br>
intermittently  </br>
mason jar lightbulbs are  </br>
aesthetic and useless  </br>
the daylight is enough  </br>
to stare into her eyes  </br>
to watch them blink  </br>
blink&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blink  </br>
stare  </br>
staring contest  </br>
the key is not to blink  </br>
good taste is key but   </br>
i wish i got what she got   </br>
old enough to know that looks aren’t  </br>
everything  </br>
but if that hair were shorter  </br>
would my heart still race  </br>
think back   </br>
or remember strangely to   </br>
find that all those friends  </br>
are losers  </br>
at least i’ve moulted conscious  </br>
enough to name that cover and   </br>
cough with restraint while fumbling over  </br>
lost names and wasted food   </br>
a slow exit and mechanical thanks is  </br>
all i can muster but you are welcome   </br>
for putting this china  </br>
away  </br>
