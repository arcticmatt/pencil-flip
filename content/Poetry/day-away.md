<strong>day — away</strong>  <br/>
sink into comfortable mundanity and  <br/>
enjoy the view through a  <br/>
two-way mirror  <br/>
outside a cleaved leaf lightly sways before  <br/>
drifting to the ground  <br/>
a squirrel   <br/>
right on schedule  <br/>
scurries over to investigate  <br/>
but spirals up the tree chased  <br/>
by a rogue companion
<br/><br/>
divorced from cares but an outsider  <br/>
taps politely on the glass  <br/>
not entirely opaque  <br/>
which slides to the right  <br/>
</span>
