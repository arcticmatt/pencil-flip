<span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size: 85%">
**awake the day**  
when the sun rises my face depresses further  
into pillows and breath builds up  
within  
releasing this rush of stale air again  
and again a gradient of sleep returns me until  
the sunâ€™s signal is too strong to ignore  
alone undercovers in soft darkness and  
easy silence is not a cheap state   
it takes effort to attain and   
none to lose  
a daily schedule   
scares the stillness away   
it is   
unsettling to rest jolted by   
monotonous reality
