<strong>awake the day</strong>  <br/>
when the sun rises my face depresses further  <br/>
into pillows and breath builds up  <br/>
within  <br/>
releasing this rush of stale air again  <br/>
and again a gradient of sleep returns me until  <br/>
the sunâ€™s signal is too strong to ignore  <br/>
alone undercovers in soft darkness and  <br/>
easy silence is not a cheap state   <br/>
it takes effort to attain and   <br/>
none to lose  <br/>
a daily schedule   <br/>
scares the stillness away   <br/>
it is   <br/>
unsettling to rest jolted by   <br/>
monotonous reality    <br/>
