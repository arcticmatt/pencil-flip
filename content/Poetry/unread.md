<p style="line-height: 110%">

<strong>unread</strong>  <br/>
in a bookstore you'll find  <br/>
an assortment of items  <br/>
from actual books to  <br/>
more knick-knacky trifles    <br/>
there's the stack of cds  <br/>
a collection of pens  <br/>
tees whose bold graphics  <br/>
recall books past read  <br/>
once these items are browsed  <br/>
curiosity sated  <br/>
itâ€™s time to move on to  <br/>
the tomes that lay waiting  <br/>
from cartoons and comics to  <br/>
movies and fiction  <br/>
philosophy psychology  <br/>
a book on addiction  <br/>
the number of spines may  <br/>
outnumber us all  <br/>
and to read through their contents  <br/>
is a task far too tall  <br/>
to read even one  <br/>
might pass the whole day  <br/>
though you may have the time  <br/>
i must be on my way  <br/>
so a visit in short  <br/>
becomes simple in nature  <br/>
browse for notable titles  <br/>
skim &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; buy for later  <br/>
in this way a bookshelf  <br/>
becomes frightening and tall  <br/>
when the books yet unread  <br/>
are most numerous of all  <br/>
and the time left to read becomes  <br/>
constantly shorter  <br/>
the clock never stops ticking we just  <br/>
keep getting older  <br/>
yet the books don't stop coming  <br/>
they just keep piling up  <br/>
while some voice in your brain  <br/>
whispers words that won't stop  <br/>
<i>don't worry about   <br/>
the old books on the shelf  <br/>
they'll be taken care of  <br/>
just take care of yourself  <br/>
keep buying books that you  <br/>
think you might read   <br/>
even if they all sit here  <br/>
indefinitely</i><br/>
in a city you'll find  <br/>
an assortment of bookstores  <br/>
