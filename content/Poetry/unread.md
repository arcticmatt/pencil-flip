Summary: 

<span style="font-family:Cantarell">
**unread**  
in a bookstore you'll find  
an assortment of items  
from actual books to  
more knick-knacky trifles    
there's the stack of cds  
a collection of pens  
tees whose bold graphics  
recall books past read  
once these items are browsed  
curiosity sated  
itâ€™s time to move on to  
the tomes that lay waiting  
from cartoons and comics to  
movies and fiction  
philosophy psychology  
a book on addiction  
the number of spines may  
outnumber us all  
and to read through their contents  
is a task far too tall  
to read even one  
might pass the whole day  
though you may have the time  
i must be on my way  
so a visit in short  
becomes simple in nature  
browse for notable titles  
skim    buy for later  
in this way a bookshelf  
becomes frightening and tall  
when the books yet unread  
are most numerous of all  
and the time left to read becomes  
constantly shorter  
the clock never stops ticking we just  
keep getting older  
yet the books don't stop coming  
they just keep piling up  
while some voice in your brain  
whispers words that won't stop  
*don't worry about   
the old books on the shelf  
they'll be taken care of  
just take care of yourself  
keep buying books that you  
think you might read   
even if they all sit here  
indefinitely*  
in a city you'll find  
an assortment of bookstores
