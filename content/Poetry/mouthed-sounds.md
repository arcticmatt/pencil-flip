Summary: 

<span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size: 85%">
**mouthed sounds**  
language is useless  
so many times i have turned and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twisted   
the same word  
the same letters and sounds  
around in my head searching for  
meaning but finding only make-believe  
what i say to her is not the same  
my speech mutates  
i laugh in defense  
with you these words are weightless  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soft syllables wilt  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gently beneath the fog  
i sense their presence by  
the turn of your lips  
flick of your hair  
bend of your knees
