<strong>mouthed sounds</strong>  <br/>
language is useless  <br/>
so many times i have turned and  <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twisted   <br/>
the same word  <br/>
the same letters and sounds  <br/>
around in my head searching for  <br/>
meaning but finding only make-believe  <br/>
what i say to her is not the same  <br/>
my speech mutates  <br/>
i laugh in defense  <br/>
with you these words are weightless  <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soft syllables wilt  <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gently beneath the fog  <br/>
i sense their presence by  <br/>
the turn of your lips  <br/>
flick of your hair  <br/>
bend of your knees  <br/>
