<strong>day's proceedings</strong>  <br/>
the question of our youths  <br/> 
what do you want to be when you grow up  <br/>
upon growing up  <br/>
it is found that you can be  <br/>
on a day to day basis  <br/>
satisfied enough and   <br/>
not unhappy  <br/>
the job looked great but feels like work  <br/>
everyone is nice but is the bar  <br/>
that low  <br/>
it’s a shared wish to  <br/>
dismiss small talk and be  <br/>
comfortable already but the   <br/>
unknown is two dimensional with no  <br/>
bookmarks and hidden requirements to ride  <br/>
so it’s easier to hear about summer weather in new york  <br/>
it’s easier to make new acquaintances and  <br/>
keep old friends  <br/>
touch one and it’s harassment   <br/>
the other   <br/>
it’s a hug  <br/>
there’s always that other   <br/>
hobby or spare-time passion  <br/>
to pursue  <br/>
there’s a job for that too  <br/>
