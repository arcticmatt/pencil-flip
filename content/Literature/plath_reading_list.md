Summary: Recommendations from the suicidal grave

'Tis the season for book lists. The New Yorker and the New York Times have theirs.
Bill Gates has his. Ryan Holiday, whose reading list I am somehow subscribed to,
has also recently e-recommended me a few life-changing reads. 

I have not, however, scrolled through any Sylvia Plath curated lists. This is most likely
because she is dead. What a shame. No one can make corncob rape or the name Ursula 
sound as scintillating as SP. So let's get to it: here is your 2015 Sylvia Plath Book List.

### *The Lord of the Rings* (trilogy) - J.R.R. Tolkien
> Finished the Tolkien trilogy. A triumph. A 
> battle of the pans and kevas. I don’t know when I have been so moved. (475) 

### *Sanctuary* by William Faulkner 
> Have been reading Faulkner. At last. Sanctuary 
> and beginning the collected stories and excerpts. Will go on a jag. Absolutely 
> flawless descriptive style: and much description: dogs, their smells, fuckings 
> and terrors. Scenes. Whorehouse interiors. Colors, humor and above all a fast 
> plot: rape with corn cobs, sexual deviation, humans shot and burned alive, he 
> gets it in. (468)

### *The Years* by Virginia Woolf 
> Reading V. Woolf’s The Years. With rain, she can 
> unite a family, here in London, there in the country, in Oxford... the descriptions, 
> the observations, the feelings caught and let slip, are fine, a luminous web 
> catching it all in, this is life, this is time. (485)

### *Ulysses* by James Joyce 
> i am reading 'ulysses.' god, it is unbelievably 
> semantically big, great, mind cracking, and even webster’s is a sterile impotent 
> enuch as far as conceiving words goes... (168)

### *The Marble Faun* by Nathaniel Hawthorne
> ‘The Marble Faun’, tedious, a Roman 
> guidebook, & yet with a sylvan and gothic charm - moonlit coliseum, skull-mortared 
> crypts, statues & paintings, masques & carnivals, & Donatello with his leaf-shaped 
> furry ears - I love having read it because of my Roman time & walked again through 
> St. Peter's & felt the mass of stone and gold and weighted jewels rise up in one 
> massive fist to strike me. (336)

### *The Rainbow* by D.H. Lawrence 
> I opened the Rainbow which I have never read & was 
> sucked into the concluding Ursula & Skrebensky episode & sank back, breath knocked 
> out of me, as I read of their London hotel, their Paris trip, their riverside 
> loving while Ursula studied at college. This is the stuff of my life - my life, 
> different, but no less brilliant & splendid, and the flow of my story will take me 
> beyond this in my way - arrogant? (337)
