Not recommended to set for your alarm clock tune. The theme of this Friday 
is **ambient / atmospheric**. I listen to these songs when I want to 
listen to music and actually do work or take a nap in the afternoon. They're also
handy when you need some neutral background music that probably no one will 
know but that is generally fairly pleasing for most chill occasions where you 
don't want much actually going on just something other than silence. Here's a 
playlist with all the songs: [the playlist with all 
the songs](https://open.spotify.com/user/1240806741/playlist/4incH0kX0BA2gDCnL8ZLaO).


#### 1. Norrland - Gidge 
The musical equivalent of an elevating hike through Norweigan Woods.
Scenic stops are included.

#### 2. I Dreamed of Choirs Slow and Steady, the Song Was Ours, Its Woe Was Heavy - Aural Method 
This is the Lord of the Rings of songs, minus the fighting parts. It starts out 
pretty chill, Frodo and Sam are in the Shire, having a good time with the other
hobbitses. Then the ring stuff happens and they have to go to Mordor and it 
starts getting intense and things start escalating and escalating and there's
tension in every look and movement. And then at the very end everything is chill
again. 

#### 3. In a Forest With Leaves in Your Hair - Sad Souls 
Much shorter than the above two songs. It's almost solely composed of a one
catchy, repetitive loop which nicely captures the song title.

#### 4. Albatross - Fleetwood Mac
Different from the others on this list, with the main melody being played on 
a guitar instead of being electronically generated. The feeling I get from it 
is -slowly floating along-. 

#### 5. Her Joy Was Complete - Sleeping At Last 
A beautiful series of escalations and declines.
