Summary: do you have time to talk?  
status: hidden  

Long time, no five track friday. Have I stopped listening to new music? Am
I too lazy to do these on a regular basis? Do multiple english classes at the
same time suck away my desire to write for fun? The answer to all these 
questions will appear on the next episode! 

Story time. Some time ago, my life was like Scott Pilgrim. I broke up with
someone, and then (an undisclosed amount of time later) got unceremoniously dumped.
It was a good time. Anyways, here are the songs I listend to shortly before/after I got dumped. 
I'll try to specify if it was before or after in the 
descriptions, just for kicks. There might be a little musical foreshadowing going
on... 

I decided to do a playlist for the "being dumped" rather than the "dump-ing"
for no reason other than that I thought of the former first. But now, while thinking
about the latter, I've realized that a playlist for "dump-ing" would just consist 
of a bunch of Belle & Sebastian songs. Belle & Sebastian is good for melancholic-happy-sad
thinking about one's less than desirable love life. Perhaps I *will* make that playlist...
But anyways, for now we're stuck with five songs associated with my breakup.
They're not particularly specific. I just kind of found 
them, liked them, and listened to them. And now they are forever associated 
with this period of my life. Welp, that's enough rambling. Here's a 
playlist with all the songs: [the playlist with all 
the songs](https://open.spotify.com/user/1240806741/playlist/4incH0kX0BA2gDCnL8ZLaO).

#### 1. You Won't See Me - The Beatles 
*Before*  
> When I call you up your line's engaged.  
> I have had enough, so act your age,  
> We have lost the time that was so hard to find,  
> And I will lose my mind,  
> If you won't see me, you won't see me.   

This song predicted my life. I guess it was bound to sooner or later. It happened
sooner. I was listening to "Norweigan Woods" while trying to play it on guitar. Then
that song ended and this song came on. It's one of those songs that sounds upbeat
and happy but the lyrics are sad. A similarly happysad song is "Always Something There
To Remind Me" by The Hippos.

#### 2. Our Love - Fingers Cut Megamachine
*Before*  
> You are a dream  
> There’s a street called Tamarind  
> I have nothing else to say    
> I’ve thought of you all day  
> Would you like to hear  
> On this side of the city  
> You should come in, say hello  
> It goes too fast  
> Oh, let it go   

This song didn't predict my life, but the lyrics are nice. Guitar + drums + voice
+ some ethereal synths that drift in and out. It's a quiet song, the kind you 
would play around a bonfire when everyone is tired and almost falling asleep
and they want something nice to listen to. The singer's voice isn't super unique,
but I haven't heard many people who sing melodies like him. Not that they're super
catchy or anything, they're just different.

#### 3. What Once Was - Her's
*Before*
> Baby I've been there before  
> I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone  
> And now I'm still hanging on  
> I was at the end of every tether waiting  
> For what once was  
 
Hmm. Also slightly predictive. I guess that's the point of songs though, they're 
supposed to be relatable. The guitar in this is dreamy in a Mac Demarco, 
kinda reminds me of "The Stars Keep On Calling My Name." This song is more
affected though. The dude's voice is super deep. The bassline is deeper.

#### 4. Is it Really So Strange? - The Smiths
*After*  
> And you can butt me  
> And you can break my spine  
> But you won't change the way I feel  
> 'Cause I love you   

Every time I listen to The Smiths I think about that one elevator scene
from *500 Days of Summer*.
I had discovered "Unloveable" a few days before, which made me listen to the 
whole album. This is my favorite song on it. Perhaps another example of a 
happysad song. Actually, looking at the lyrics again, definitely another 
example. The general sound makes you want to dance. The lyrics make you 
think dang Morrissey you are an emotional man. They tell the story of a 
man who's obsessed with a woman, but she doesn't love him. Throughout,
Morrissey continually laments his inability to change his feelings. And,
that's about it. Simple, but again, I'm sure most people can relate.

#### 5. Something for Your M.I.N.D.
*After*  
I was bumping this after the breakup. It's the jam. It's funky and groovy
and makes me do the dance where I kinda just step around and bob my head
in rhythm(?).
> Something for your mind (Mind)  
> (무엇인가 정신에 집어넣으세요. 마음에 어떤 것 필요합니까?  
> 정신에 집어넣으세요.)  
> M, I  
> M, I  
> M, I, N, D  
 
I don't know what it means, but it's provocative. Well, I kind of know. I can
speculate. The songwriter sets up the chorus by saying "I think you know what 
I need to get by" in the first verse, and "I don't know what you need to get
by" in the second verse. Given this, it seems she is talking to someone,
perhaps an ex-lover, and telling him that he needs something to think about. 
To put this in concrete terms, lets consider a classic example. In *War and Peace*,
after Natasha calls off the marriage, Andrey gets pretty depressed. He tries
dealing with this depression by throwing himself headfirst into loads of work.
In other words, he tries to occupy his mind. This is a common technique after
a breakup - it helps to have other stuff to think about when getting over 
somebody (otherwise you might fall into the trap of thinking about them all
the time, which is probably what Morrissey does). So, that's one possible
meaning. I also like to think that she's declaring her song to be that "something."
The chorus tells us what this song is for - it's something for your (our) mind (minds).
It can distract us, make us dance, make us happy. Music is cool.

Honorable Mentions: "Hey Good Lookin'" and "Lucky Girl," discovered amidst dozens
of other indie music Youtube videos.
