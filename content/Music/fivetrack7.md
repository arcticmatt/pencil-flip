Long time, no five track friday. Have I stopped listening to new music? Am
I too lazy to do these on a regular basis? Do multiple english classes at the
same time suck away my desire to write for fun? The answer to all these 
questions will appear on the next episode! 

Story time. Some time ago, my life was like Scott Pilgrim. I broke up with
someone, and then (an undisclosed amount of time later) got unceremoniously dumped.
It was a good time. Anyways, here are the songs I listend to shortly before/right
after I got dumped. I'll try to specify if it was before or after in the 
descriptions, just for kicks. There might be a little musical foreshadowing going
on... I decided to do a playlist for the "being dumped" rather than the "dump-ing"
for no reason other than that I thought of the former first. But now, while thinking
about the latter, I've realized that a playlist for "dump-ing" would consist 
of a bunch of Belle & Sebastian songs. Belle & Sebastian is good for melancholic-happy-sad
thinking about one's less than desirable love life. Perhaps I will do that playlist...
But anyways, for now we're stuck with five songs associated with my breakup.
And it is specifically "my-ne" (i.e. random) because I didn't go searching for breakup songs or 
start immediately listening to angsty punk rock afterwards. I just kind of found 
these songs, liked them, and listened to them. And now they are forever associated 
with this period of my life. Welp, that's enough rambling. Here's a 
playlist with all the songs: [the playlist with all 
the songs](https://open.spotify.com/user/1240806741/playlist/4incH0kX0BA2gDCnL8ZLaO).

#### 1. Norrland - Gidge 
The musical equivalent of an elevating hike through Norweigan Woods.
Scenic stops are included.

#### 2. I Dreamed of Choirs Slow and Steady, the Song Was Ours, Its Woe Was Heavy - Aural Method 
This is the Lord of the Rings of songs, minus the fighting parts. It starts out 
pretty chill, Frodo and Sam are in the Shire, having a good time with the other
hobbitses. Then the ring stuff happens and they have to go to Mordor and it 
starts getting intense and things start escalating and escalating and there's
tension in every look and movement. And then at the very end everything is chill
again. 

#### 3. In a Forest With Leaves in Your Hair - Sad Souls 
Much shorter than the above two songs. It's almost solely composed of one
catchy, repetitive loop which nicely captures the song title.

#### 4. Albatross - Fleetwood Mac
Different from the others on this list, with the main melody played on 
guitar instead of electronically generated. The feeling I get from it 
is -slowly floating along-. 

#### 5. Her Joy Was Complete - Sleeping At Last 
A beautiful series of escalations and declines.
