Summary: We really wanna know

We really wanted love. The theme of this Friday is **ambiguous love**. Have a 
listen while thinking too hard about a text, scrolling Facebook, or spinning
in a chair. Here's a playlist with all the songs: [the playlist with all 
the songs](https://open.spotify.com/user/1240806741/playlist/4incH0kX0BA2gDCnL8ZLaO).

#### 1. Vow - Sales
Minimal (but distinct) percussion + simple and clear electric guitar melodies +
textured female vocals. 

#### 2. Beyond Love - Beach House
The instrumental is oh so good to the point where I don't really care what
the guy is singing about. Even in this apathetic state the glossolia vocals 
in combination with the piano/synth/beautiful-noises/etc. are evocative and
lovely and slightly sad.

#### 3. Don't Watch Me Dancing - Little Joy
This song does an awkward dance in my head. People dancing can be 
funny/beautiful/awkward/dramatic/breathtakign. This song is a bit of each of those
things. Maybe not that breathtaking.

#### 4. Waiting - Alice Boman
One of those really simple songs, lyrically speaking, that conveys a simple idea
but is emotionally powerful. Here, the idea is "i'm waiting come back i need you
i want you." It's ideated nicely.

#### 5. No Time For Us (Acoustic) - Broder Daniel
Another lyrically simple, yet emotionally powerful song.
