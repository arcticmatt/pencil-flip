Summary: See you on a dark night

Q: If you had a daemon, what would it be? The theme of this Friday is
**muses**. Listen whilst reading Pyramus and Thisbe, wallowing in idealism,
or eating a breakfast burrito. Here's a playlist with all the songs: [the playlist with all 
the songs](https://open.spotify.com/user/1240806741/playlist/4incH0kX0BA2gDCnL8ZLaO).

#### 1. Oblivion - Grimes
A: the hyena, and/or the baluga. Lithe & infectious & pop & as joyously floaty
as backstroking through a pool of air.

#### 2. Coffee - Sylvan Esso
Rhythmically mesmerizing. 

#### 3. Running With The Wolves - Aurora
Watching Aurora sing is like observing a non-creepy exorcism, or watching the 
invention of really emotive sign language. She sings in a mythical way, emitting
emotion with word and sound.

#### 4. Animal Tracks - Mountain Man
A trio of liberal arts women (one of whom is the singer in Sylvan Esso) who
harmonize even better than those girls in Pitch Perfect. This song belongs in a 
fairy tale, or maybe one of the more happy/wistful scenes of The Lord of the Rings.

#### 5. Lucky - Kat Edmonson
These sounds are similar to a light mizzle on a sunny day.
