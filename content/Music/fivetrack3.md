Summary: Should've stayed in bed today

The clear vowels rise like ballons. The theme of this faux-Friday is 
**panic attacks & conversations**. Play these songs when all your friends
are getting married, while you realize you have no idea what to do with
your life, or if you want to participate in a one-sided, rhythmic conversation.
Here's a playlist with all the songs: [the playlist with all 
the songs](https://open.spotify.com/user/1240806741/playlist/4incH0kX0BA2gDCnL8ZLaO).

#### 1. Avant Gardener - Courtney Barnett
Courtney Barnett, self-described doofus: 'Every day I have some sort of 
breakdown.' This song is about having an 'allergy-induced anxiety attack' while 
gardening. It inspires both nothing and everything.

#### 2. What I Am - Edie Brickell & New Bohemians
A song about what I am; philosophy; religion; choking in shallow water; and 
so on. If you pay too much attention it might stop making sense. If you pay
any attention it might stop making sense.

#### 3. Pot Kettle Black - Wilco
Every moment *is* a little bit later. I'd like to believe the singing is
cathartic; the listening, more surely so.

#### 4. Cottonmouth - the FINKS
Happy-sad sing-song guy-girl Australian rock.

#### 5. Melanie - TV Girl
There's this girl named Melanie. She looks a lot like Jane. Jane looks a lot 
like Amy, who looks a lot like Amy. Melanie never really talks to you. She's
always looking across the room, at someone who just came inside.
