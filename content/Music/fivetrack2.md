Summary: Art school makes you wild

Fem spår på en fredag. The theme of this Friday is **fuzzy fem**. These
tracks will fit comfortably alongside an afternoon of econometrics,
an early morning shower, or a rainy Tuesday. Here's a playlist
with all the songs: [the playlist with all 
the songs](https://open.spotify.com/user/1240806741/playlist/4incH0kX0BA2gDCnL8ZLaO).

#### 1. Birthday Song - Frankie Cosmos
A birthday song about hating everybody and sitting alone. Frankie seems like
a cupcake kind of person.

#### 2. Cool Slut - Chastity Belt
Just four girls from Walla Walla Washington singing about being sluts. If this song
was a person, it would wear relaxed blue jeans (slightly worn) and colorful wool
sweaters.

#### 3. Mr. Oh so Suave & Debonaire - Gaze
What's better, the song title or the song itself? A possible candidate for "play-it-to-your-friend-who-just-got-dumped-as-you-comfort-her" song.

#### 4. 90210 - The Courtneys
I love letting the ocean fill me with emotion. But when the ocean's not nearby,
this song'll do. Fun fact: Mac Demarco and The Courtneys are buds.

#### 5. Fir Coat - Widowspeak
This song is about firs and coats and maybe fur coats or possibly fir coats.
Perhaps a fir coat is fashion nouveau, Derelicte, manic menswear. I cannot 
say for sure.
