Summary: Written while eating a peach

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bildungsroman is a romantic sounding word. It is "a novel about the moral
and psychological growth of the main character." A quote from the New 
Yorker describes *My Brilliant Friend* as a "large, captivating, amiably
peopled bildungsroman," and I'd say that's fairly accurate. I'd liken 
it to a modern, Italian, better written version of *Pride and Prejudice*.
This isn't a perfect comparison. Unlike *Pride and Prejudice*, I actually
enjoyed this book. There are also some other differences. But first,
some similarities. Both plots are centered around the lives of 
courtable women; romance plays a major role in the lives of these women;
plots advance along with romantic relationships, and relationships advance
family wealth and value; relationships are used as a launching pad for 
major themes. These are fairly general similarities. Based on this 
criteria, I could be comparing *Bend it like Beckham* with the life of 
my grandma. I think it was ch. 16 that really put *Pride and 
Prejudice* (which, by the way, is the only Jane Austen novel I've ever 
read) into my mind. In this chapter, Lila dances with a variety of boys,
many of whom are either interested in her, protective of her, jealous
of someone who is interested in her, or some combination of the above. 
Vague images of Elizabeth and Darcy dancing to a piano immediately sprung 
to my mind some ten minutes later. Basically, my brain tends towards
simplifying both these novels into "girls talking about and maybe
dancing with boys who they then start dating."   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, some major differences. As aforementioned, *Pride 
and Prejudice* is really boring. This book is pretty entertaining. Second,
the writing is much better. It's not just "and she said this and he said
that and she looked and him and he wasn't looking and her mom was being 
stupid and her dad said nothing etc. etc. etc." I will note that Elena 
Ferrante really likes to throw a crapton of commas into her sentences:

> When the two young men returned, interrupting our conversation, 
Pasquale confessed, laughing, that he had left the work site without 
saying anything to the boss, so he had to go back right away. (130)

That's five in one - not too bad for just flipping to a random page. It's 
not a negative per se, just a certain style. It can get a little jumbled
at times if you're not used to it though. Third, the "major themes" I 
mentioned earlier are different. Whereas *Pride and Prejudice* talks 
about pride and prejudice, *My Brilliant Friend* is about family heritage
and tradition. More specifically, it depicts the life of someone raised in 
a very specific environment, where people go on to lead very specific
lives, and asks the question: can she break free? What is it like to 
try? How does an old generation raise a new one?   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are small moments of bittersweetness contained throughout the book,
which reads slightly like a journal from someone who is straining 
to remember. The feeling of missing an old friend when she's standing
right in front of you, of barely remembering someone while they hug you 
tightly, of hating a parent that a sibling adores - all these are 
captured and stated in simple yet moving ways. Here are some quotes
that may or may not be unrelated to anything I have previously said.

> Marisa threw her arms around my neck with an enthusiasm I would never 
have expected: in all those years I had never, absolutely never, thought 
of her, while she said she had often thought of me with great nostalgia.

> But the violence of those few carefully constructed sentenced hurt me. 
Nino hated his father with all his strength, that was why be talked so 
much about the Karamazovs. But that wasn't the point. What disturbed me 
profoundly was that Donato Sarratore, as far as I had seen with my own 
eyes, heard with my own ears, was not repellent, he was the father that 
every girl, every boy should want, and Marisa in fact adored him. (221)

> [about Lila's writing] ...she left no trace of effort, you weren't 
aware of the artifice of the written word. I read and I saw her, I heard 
her. The voice set in the writing overwhelmed me, enthralled me even more 
than when we talked face to face: it was completely cleansed of the cross 
of speech, of the confusion of the oral... (227)

> I had never seen her naked, I was embarrassed. Today I can say that it 
was the embarrassment of gazing with pleasure at her body, of being the not
impartial witness of her sixteen-year-old's beauty a few hours before 
Stefano touched her, penetrated her, disfigured her, perhaps, by making 
her pregnant. At the time it was just a tumultuous sensation of necessary
awkwardness, a state in which you cannot avert the gaze or take away 
the hand without recognizing your own turmoil, without, by that retreat,
declaring it, hence without coming into concfict with the undisturbed
innocence of the one who is the cause of the turmoil... (312)


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is an easy and fast read. There are three other books in the 
series, and while I hadn't the strongest urge to read the next right after
finishing the first, I think I'll get around to it. There's nothing about 
the book that blew me away, no specific passages that I stopped to read 
again and again. But it's interesting, relatable, and the characters 
stick with you (their names are repeated so many times it's kind of 
inevitable). There's romance and drama and dissatisifcation with life, and
that's enough to satisfy me.
