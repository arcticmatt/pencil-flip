Summary: If I write it with an ampersand is it not legit

I finally finished *War and Peace*. The story starts on page 5 (never really got
why they don’t just start on page 1), and the epilogue ends on page 1358.
There are also 13 pages of footnotes, most of which I did not read, 2 pages of
character names and summaries, some maps, a section containing summaries of
each chapter, the introduction, translator’s note, etc. etc.. Let’s just say
that I read 1350 pages. This is the Penguin Classics version, translated by
Anthony Briggs, in case you were wondering. Having finished, I can now say
that the longest book I’ve ever read is 1350 pages. *Don Quixote* (books I and
II) and *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* are close contenders, coming
in at 940 and 870 pages, respectively. It should be noted that the font in
Harry Potter is very kid-friendly. Why did I read a book this long? The main
answer you see on Amazon reviews is “so that I can say that I read it.” My
answer is kind of similar. Two summers ago, I was talking with a friend. We
were trying to figure out what book to read, and (if I recall correctly) she
suggested *War and Peace*. I had suggested some shorter titles, but she didn’t
seem very interested. I didn’t know much about *War and Peace* at the time; a
few associated words in my mind were big, long, Russian, novel. I was
skeptical that we would ever start reading the book, let alone finish it, but
I went along with it; reading *War and Peace* seemed like an interesting thing
to do. We proceeded to both buy the book, talk about reading it, and got 100
pages in before giving up. That is, until more than a year later. By that
point, I knew a little more about *War and Peace*. I still didn’t really have a
strong incentive to read it; I wasn’t that interested in Russian history or
Napoleon or stories with super general titles. My interests were more strongly
aligned with that of the masses: read it for the sake of reading it (and to be
able to say I’ve read it). Anyways, my friend and I figured our fall terms
weren’t that busy, and set out for a pace of ~100 pages a week; in this way,
we finished in time for winter break. On a related note, you can read the thoughts
of Katherine (the friend) [here](http://petrichorate.tumblr.com/post/154668446484/war-and-peace-thoughts-2930).
I just read it and it's actually kinda similar, probably because we exchanged words irl.
Just go read it it's good. Also on another related note, the BBC show is pretty
good. Pierre looks kinda weird. Helene looks good. I'm not sure if it would
make any sense if you haven't read the book though.  
<br/>

I won’t bore you with a detailed plot summary; I’m sure you can find that
somewhere else on the internet. I will, however, give my version of a very
high level summary. Let’s do it in five sentences. *War and Peace* is about the
French invasion of Russia, which began in 1812. The peace parts follow the
lives of various Russian families. Their storylines often intersect and are
affected by the war. The war parts follow the narrative of the war, talking
about the soldiers as well as higher ups like the Tsar, Napoleon, and Kutuzov.
There are also more philosophical sections during which Tolstoy lectures the
reader about history, free will, etc.   
<br/>

I found the peace parts much more interesting than the war parts, which seems
to be the general consensus amongst the Amazon reviews that I read (not a huge
sample size, I have other things to do). There are a ton of characters, and
they’re all relatable in some way. Tolstoy is really good at writing sentences
that you read and then think: “oh yea, that’s totally true,” or “oh yea,
that’s me.” In general, Tolstoy’s writing is really nice and easy to read. He
jumps easily from the big picture to personal minutiae, interweaving all the
different narratives and characters together in a seamless fashion. I like to
think of the peace parts as a soap opera, or an old-fashioned sitcom. Maybe a
sitcom isn’t the best description because people die and stuff (spoilers!!!),
and I don’t really know what a soap opera is, but hear me out anyways. I say
they’re similar because you have a core group of characters whose
personalities are thoroughly developed and displayed, and then you’ve got all
these other characters on the periphery who are not as well developed and can
be described by just a few essential qualities or scenes. Throughout the
narrative, the core characters interact with each other and with the secondary
cast. There’s a lot of personal and interpersonal drama, stuff that you would
gossip about with your friends: “he likes *her*?”; “she said *what* in that
letter?”; etc.. A lot of this is conveyed through dialogue, which is often
very entertaining and relatable. The main characters also change a lot,
whether it’s forced upon them by some big event or a revelatory decision made
on their own. In summary, you have a core group of characters, who change a
lot but who still retain distinct personalities, and who interact with each
other and with the outer cast. And the story is about these people, their
lives and thoughts and growth. So it’s basically like *How I Met Your Mother*.   
<br/>

The war parts are not as interesting. They talk about what it’s like to be a
soldier in war, so there are some action scenes. They also talk about what
it’s like to be an adjutant, or a commander, so there are a lot of scenes from
their perspectives talking more about the strategic/communicative/political
aspects of war. There’s a lot of discussion on power, or the causes of war,
and what actually makes certain events happen. For example, Tolstoy will
question why the Russians retreated from Moscow. I’m too lazy to really
discuss this here, but his main point is that historians who attribute events
to single people are wrong. That is, if you say that the French won a battle
because Napoleon is a genius, you are being ignorant of a whole host of other
factors. One needs to consider the entirety of the situation, the individual
soldiers fighting, the whole chain of command, in order to truly determine why
events happen as they do. I include a quote about this below (the one on page
914). I found Tolstoy’s musings about all this philosophical stuff to be a bit
distracting from the story, and they weren’t particularly clear or convincing.  
<br/>

A few more random opinions I’d like to express. The beginning and ending
sentences are pretty terrible. The last 40 pages are Tolstoy’s philosophical
musings, which was very unsatisfactory. I had just read 1300 pages for this
guy, and he throws a bunch of complicated logic about free will at me. C’mon
man.   
<br/>

Finally, here are some quotes that I liked. I probably bookmarked around 50
places in this book, so I won’t list all of them. I will still list a lot of
them though. It was kind of a pain to copy these because my particular version
is not very conducive to laying flat open. I really wish Penguin would more
strongly consider than when thinking about page dimensions and such. Ah well,
here are the quotes - spoilers ahead.   
<br/>


> **About relationships**  
“Even in the very warmest, friendliest and simplest of relationships you need
either flattery or praise in the way that you need grease to keep wheels
turning” (31).   

<!-- -->
> **Pierre in confusion**  
“Pierre was in such a confused state of mind that the word ‘stroke’ made him
think of a blow from some heavy body” (83). 

<!-- -->
> **About the time of departure**  
“At a time of departure and change thinking people usually find themselves in
a serious frame of mind. At such a time you tend to review the past and make
plans for the future” (108). 

<!-- -->
> **About seeing the enemy before battle**  
“‘One step across that dividing line, so like the one between the living and
the dead, and you enter an unknown world of suffering and death. What will you
find there? Who will be there? There, just beyond that field, that tree, that
sunlit roof? No one knows, and yet you want to know. You dread crossing that
line, and yet you still want to cross it. You know sooner or later you will
have to go across and find out what is there beyond it, just as you must
inevitably find out what lies beyond death. Yet here you are, fit and strong,
carefree and excited, with men all around you just the same - strong, excited
and full of life.’ This is what all men think when they get a sight of the
enemy, or they feel it if they do not think it, and it is this feeling that
gives a special lustre and a delicious edge to the awareness of everything
that is now happening” (150). 

<!-- -->
> **Description of Bilibin**  
“Bilibin enjoyed talking as much as working, as long as the conversation was
stylish and clever. In society he always hung back, waiting for a chance to
say something very striking, and would not enter any conversation unless he
could do so. His speech was invariably salted with polished phrases, original,
witty but of general application. They were fabricated in some inner
laboratory of Bilibin’s mind, portable and ready-made for social nonentities
to commit to memory and take around the other drawing-rooms. Bilibin’s bons
mots, widely peddled in every Viennese salon, often went on to influence what
people thought of as important matters” (162). 

<!-- -->
> **Description of Anatole**   
“Besides that, in his dealings with the fair sex Anatole had mastered the
special attitude that most effectively arouses a woman’s curiosity, awe and
even love - an attitude of disdainful awareness of his own superiority. His
manner seemed to say to them, ‘I know you, yes I do, but why should I make the
effort? That’s just what you’d like me to do!’” (236).

<!-- -->
> **Anatole on the glory of battle**  
“‘Death, wounds, the loss of my family - nothing can frighten me. I know many
people are dear and precious to me, my father, my sister, my wife - my nearest
and dearest, yet, however terrible and unnatural it may seem, I would give
them all up for one moment of glory, triumph over men, to be loved by men I
don’t even know, and never shall know, to be loved by these people there...’”
(281). 

<!-- -->
> **About freezing when you see the girl you like (or the Tsar)**  
“But, just as a lovelorn youth dithers and freezes, too scared to force out
the words he has dreamt about for nights on end, panics and looks around for
help or any chance of delay and escape now that the longed-for moment is here
and he and she are alone together, so Rostov, suddenly presented with what he
wanted most in all the world, had no idea how to approach the Emperor, and his
mind was assailed by thousands of reasons why it would be wrong, inconvenient
and impossible to do so” (307). 

<!-- -->
> **About being too busy for women**  
“But he was at that stage of a young man’s life when he thinks he is too busy
for that sort of thing and he is reluctant to tie himself down because freedom
is so precious and necessary when there is so much to be done” (325). 

<!-- -->
> **About self-delusion**  
“She did notice him, but she was in such high spirits at that moment, so
remote from sorrow, gloom and censure, that she deliberately indulged in a
little self-delusion, as young people often do. ‘No, I’m too happy at this
moment to spoil my happiness by sympathizing with someone else’s sorrow,’ was
what she felt, though she said to herself, ‘No, I’ve probably got it all
wrong. He must be as happy as I am’” (369). 

<!-- -->
> **About reuniting with a friend**  
“It always happens that when friends come together after a long separation the
conversation jumps from one topic to another. Quick questions were met with
short answers as they touched on things which they knew ought to be discussed
at length” (411). 

<!-- -->
> **About being jaded**  
“‘Springtime, love and happiness!’ this tree seemed to be saying. ‘Aren’t you
fed up with it all, this stupid, senseless sham? It never changes, the same
old trick! There is no springtime, sunshine or happiness. Just look at those
dead fir-trees sitting there where they’ve been brought down, always the same
everyone one of them, and look at me sticking out broken, peeling fingers
wherever they care to grow - out of my back, out of my sides. That’s how
they’ve grown, and that’s how I am, and I don’t believe in any of your hopes
and shams’” (455). 

<!-- -->
> **About meeting someone new**  
“As people often do, particularly those who are highly critical of their
fellow men, Prince Andrey, on meeting someone new - especially someone like
Speransky whom he knew but reputation - always entertained the hope of
discovering in him a perfect blend of human qualities” (465). 

<!-- -->
> **About husbands and wives**  
“Berg judged women by the standards of his own wife and considered all of them
feeble and foolish. Vera judged men by the standards of her own husband and,
extrapolating from him alone, she found all men conceited and self-centred,
each convinced he was the only one with any sense whereas he didn’t actually
understand anything at all” (510).

<!-- -->
> **About love and possession**  
“Prince Andrey held her hand and gazed into her eyes, though in his heart he
felt no trace of his former love for her. A change had come over his inner
being. Gone was the former desire with all its poetry and mysterious charm.
Now all he felt was pity for her feminine and childish frailty, dismay at her
devotion and willingness to trust, and the hard, sweet taste of duty that must
bind him to her for ever. This new feeling may have been less glorious and
poetical, but it was stronger and more serious than before” (522). 

<!-- -->
> **About idleness**  
“And there is one such state of enforced and irreproachable idleness enjoyed
by an entire class of men - the military class. It is this state of enforced
and irreproachable idleness that forms the chief attraction of military
service, and it always will” (533). 

<!-- -->
> **About love, now**   
“At that moment Natasha felt so overwhelmed by softness and tenderness that it
wasn’t enough for her to love and know she was loved in return - now was what
mattered, she wanted to embrace the man she loved now, to talk about love and
hear love-talk from him, because her heart was filled with words of love”
(614). 

<!-- -->
> **About Napoleon's cold**  
“Many historians tell us that the French failed to win the battle of Borodino
because Napoleon had a cold, and if he hadn’t had a cold the orders he issued
before and during the battle would have marked him out even more clearly as a
genius, and Russia would have been destroyed and the face of the world would
have been changed” (870). 

<!-- -->
> **About history**  
“In order to study the laws of history we must change the subject completely,
forget all about kings, ministers and generals, and turn to the homogeneous,
infinitesimal elements that move the masses to action. No one can say how far
it is within man’s grasp to arrive at the laws of history in this way, but it
is obvious that this is the only possible way of discovering any historical
laws, and human intelligence has hitherto not devoted to this way of thinking
a millionth part of the effort that historians have put into describing the
doings of various kings, ministers and generals, and expounding their opinions
of these doings” (914). 

<!-- -->
> **About happiness**  
“‘Our ’appiness, me dear, be like water in a drag-net. Swells out lovely when
you pulls; take it out and it’s empty. Yes, that’s the way things be’” (1078). 

<!-- -->
> **About conversation judges**  
“He felt that now there was a judge listening to his every word and every
action, someone whose judgement mattered more than the judgement of everybody
else in the world. Here he was talking, and with every word he spoke he was
conscious of the impression he was making on Natasha. He didn’t go out of his
way to say things that might please her, but whatever he said, he was judging
himself from her point of view” (1241).
