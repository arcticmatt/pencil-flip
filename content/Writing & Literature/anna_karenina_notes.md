#### 3.7
* Stepan Arkadyich, goes to Petersburg and lives in summer houses

* Dolly brings up Kitty and Levin changes the subject to cows
* Dolly doesn't trust his advice on cows (he's a farmer though...)

#### 3.10
* Dolly brings up Kitty again. "Why are you angry with her?"
* Levin tells her about his rejected proposal, which she didn't know about
* "'For you men, who are free and can choose, it's always clear whom you love.
But a young girl in a state of expectation, with that feminine, maidenly modesty,
a girl who sees you men from afar, who takes everything on trust - a girl may and
does sometimes feel that she doesn't know who she loves or what to say'" (270).

so Levin goes and sorts stuff out
* Some stuff about a young married man and his wife loading hay

#### 3.12
* Levin is still watching the hay people
* "Levin had often admired this life, had often experienced a feeling of envy for
the people who lived this life, but that day for the first time, especially
under the impression of what he had seen in the relations of Ivan Parmenov and his
young wife, the thought came clearly to Levin that it was up to him to change that
so burdensome, idle, artificial and individual life he lived into this laborious,
pure and common, lovely life" (275).
* "One thing is sure, that this night has decided my fate" (276).
* Levin comes to this big revelation that he wants to renounce his old life and
take up the "farm" life. But he doesn't really know how to make the transition.
* He changes his mind when he sees Kitty on her way to Yergushovo.

#### 3.13
* Alexei Alexandrovich has one weakness: he can't hear/see the tears of a child or a
woman with indifference. He gets angry and loses reason.
* This is why he adopts a look of deadness when Anaa tells him about Vronsky and cries
* Alexei compares finding out about Vronsky to the pulling of a long-aching tooth
* Feelings for his son also change
* Alexei thinks now of what to do. He wants to hinder the relationship of Anna and Vronsky.
Wants redemption/vengeance.
  * Duel? Nah
  * Divorce? Nah
  * "...became convinced hat there was only one solution: to keep her with him,
  concealing what had happened from society, and taking all possible measures to stop
  their affair and above all - something he did not admit to himself - to punish her" (282).

* Both are beautiful with nice eyes
* Liza, Stremov, and Anna engage in conversation
* This conversation is cut short, as Anna must go to Vrede to meet Vronsky

#### 3.19
* "Every man, knowing to the smallest detail all the complexity of the conditions
surrounding him, involuntarily assumes that the complexity of these conditions
and the difficulty of comprehending them are only his personal, accidental
preculiarity, and never thinks that others are surrounded by the same
complexity as he is" (302).
* Vronsky sorts out his debts and thinks about his financial situation

#### 3.20
* Vronsky's code of rules unquestionably define his life... but Anna is making
things more complicated
* Reminder: Anna is pregnant
* "Ambition was the old dream of his childhood and youth, a dream which he
did not confess even to himself, but which was so strong that even now this passion
struggled with his love" (306)
* Slightly torn between pursuing career and Anna
* Settles (I think) for keeping his position and Anna... so not fully devoting himself
to either
* *Possessing* Anna prevents him from envy

#### 3.21
* There's a celebration for Serpukhovskoy's arrival (old classmate, got a bunch of promotions in Central Asia)
*  Some ceremonial crap happens
* Vronsky and Serpukhovskoy sit down and talk careers and women
* Serpukhovskoy belives Vronsky wants, or will want, a more prestigious career
* They skirt around the topic of Anna
* "'Women are the main stumbling block in a man's activity. It's hard to love a woman
and do anything. For this there exists one means of loving conveniently, without hindrance - that is marriage" (312)
  * Compares marriage to carrying a burden on back instead of with hands

* Anna shows Vronsky the letter and is disappointed with his reaction
