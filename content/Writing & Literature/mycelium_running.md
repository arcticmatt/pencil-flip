Summary: Take out the "Help" and you have the title of a new Buzzfeed article

I'm going to try to start doing shorter reviews. That way, I can write a short
review after each book I read, instead of only doing long ones every fifth book
or so. The structure I just thought of is as follows. First, I'll do a short
summary. Then, I'll give my opinion of the book, also short. Finally, I'll 
list some interesting tidbits or something. Let's see how this goes.

## Summary
If you go to the Amazon page for this book, do the "Look Inside!" thing,
and read the table of contents, you'll have a pretty good idea of what
this book is about.

But if you're too lazy, or want to hear the summary in my own very
original words, then look no further. Don't take that literally. Look
a little further.

Part 1 is titled "The Mycelial Mind." It's basically like a primer
for the rest of the book, an executive summary of mycelium and mushrooms.
Stamets (the author, who seems like a cool
dude) talks about how mycelium is like nature's internet; it both
physically mimics it, as they're both big interconnected networks, and
functionally mimics it, because forests "communicate" through mycelium.
I know that's a bit hand wavey, but I need to keep this short.

He then talks about the lifecycle of mushrooms. Next, he discusses
the four categories of mushrooms - saprophytic, parasitic, mycorrhizal, 
and endophytic - and their natural habitats. Finally, he talks 
about how mushrooms can be used for medicinal purposes.

Ok, that's the first part. That was way too long. Let's simplify.

Part 2 is titled "Mycorestoration." Here, Stamets covers a variety of
ways in which mycelium can help support, protect, and restore 
ecosystems. It can do so in four ways: mycofiltration, mycoforestry,
mycoremediation, and mycopesticides. If you want to know more then
google it.

Part 3 is titled "Growing Mycelia and Mushrooms." It is what it 
sounds like. There's also a long chapter that goes into detail
about certain mushroom species. It's got info on taxonomy, habitat,
culinary stuff, mycorestoration applications, and more.

## Opinions
I've become a mycophile over the past couple of weeks. I already liked
eating mushrooms before, but now I'm actually reading about them
and stuff. Before reading this book, I read David Arora's *All
That the Rain Promises and More*, so I had a working knowledge
of different types of mushrooms, their physical attributes,
their habitats, stuff like that. Even so, there was surprisingly
little overlap. Ok maybe not that surprising. But *Mycelium Running*
is definitely not a field guide like *All That the Rain...* First of 
all, a large part of the book isn't about mushrooms, it's about
mycelium. Secondofly, the part that is about mushrooms has 
different information than Arora's handy handbook - there's a lot more
emphasis on human and environmental benefits. What I'm trying to say
here is that this book has a lot of unique information.

So, who does this book cater to? I would say everyone. Mushrooms
are dope. There are so many different ways to use mushrooms, so many
aspects of our lives to which they relate. If you want to grow
mushrooms, you should read this book. If you want to help your
local ecosystem, you should read this book. 
If you garden, you should read this book. If you
like to look at cool pictures of mushrooms, you should read this book.
Blah blah blah.

If anything, this book should get you excited about mushrooms!
It's not a manual, it's a kickstarter. It
gives general outlines for mycorestorations and general outlines 
for growing mushrooms, and leaves it up to us (the readers!) to figure
it out. After all, there's a ton of stuff we don't know about mushrooms,
and no better way to find out than by getting our hands a little dirty.

## Cool Stuff

* You can grow mushrooms exponentially. You buy some spawn from 
online, and use it to inculate some substrate. For this example,
let's say the substrate is cardboard. Then, once the 
cardboard is myceliated, you stick it between two other pieces of
cardboard. And so on. Basically, you can double your output
every iteration. At least, that's the understanding I had. It's
probably more complicated in real life. 
* Related to the above point, it seems extremely easy to grow extremely
large amounts of psilocybin mushrooms (which is illegal in some 
countries). I wonder how common it is...
* Some researcher guy put mycelium in a maze and it figured out the 
shortest path (there was food at both endpoints)
* *Fomes fomentarius* is a fire-starter mushroom! People used it 
to transport fires. They also used it as punk, i.e. stuff used to
ignite gunpowder.
* A lot of mushrooms have antitumor properties.
* In a cubic inch of topsoil, the total amount of mycelium has a length
of more than 8 miles. 
* The average human accumulates between 10 and 100 million fungal
spores on his or her body and clothes per day.
* Mushrooms can improve the health and bearings of fruits and 
vegetables.

It's a bit late so I'm probably missing some stuff. At least I finally
succeeded in keeping a post kinda short.
