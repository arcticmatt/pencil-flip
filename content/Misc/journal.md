These last weeks have been quite eventful. These events have been more bad
than good. However, they are kind of interesting. Let me do a quick summary.

Over the past 2 weeks or so, I basically lived out Scott Pilgrim's life.

Now, for some day-to-day stuff.

Feb. 24: Hang out with Chloe (book stores, polaroid camera, Poo-bah commercial).
I'd say this was a good thing.
Feb. 25: Hang out with R (LA Art Book Fair @Geffen, j-town). This was fun,

been a bad move). I do the take-a-big-breath-in-preparation-and-then-wuss-out
thing many times. Then, when she's about to leave, I'm like: "Wait." And then
I'm silent for a few seconds. Anyways, the breakup went very well. She said
she kinda expected it (hm not sure if that's actually good) and we agreed to 
be friends. Then she played guitar (she had told me she was learning some songs)
and left. This is good - I made a decision and didn't cheat like Ross on Friends.
March 4: Ask R how her week was. She says it was "Kinda emotionally taxing" but
doesn't talk about it more. I ask her if she wants to grab lunch, and she's like
I'm swamped I'm a slug blah blah blah.
March 8: R hits me with the "can we talk" text. After I get this text I
