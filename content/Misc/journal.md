These last weeks have been quite eventful. These events have been more bad
than good. However, they are kind of interesting. Let me do a quick summary.

Over the past 2 weeks or so, I basically lived out Scott Pilgrim's life.

Now, for some day-to-day stuff.

Feb. 24: Hang out with Chloe (book stores, polaroid camera, Poo-bah commercial).
I'd say this was a good thing.
Feb. 25: Hang out with R (LA Art Book Fair @Geffen, j-town). This was fun,
so I'd classify it as good. When I drop her off I DTR. Definitely good! Even
if she said she wanted to breakup, which she didn't, it would still be good -
I'm getting better at this whole talking to girls thing!!! But she also said
she wanted to keep hanging out and that we're somewhere in between friends and
bf/gf (basically that we're more than just friends). Certainly that must be good.
Feb. 27: Chloe comes over to return *On Love*. We talk for about 2 hours. Watch
some longboarding on youtube, watch the *500 Days of Summer* trailer (might've
been a bad move). I do the take-a-big-breath-in-preparation-and-then-wuss-out
thing many times. Then, when she's about to leave, I'm like: "Wait." And then
I'm silent for a few seconds. Anyways, the breakup went very well. She said
she kinda expected it (hm not sure if that's actually good) and we agreed to 
be friends. Then she played guitar (she had told me she was learning some songs)
and left. This is good - I made a decision and didn't cheat like Ross on Friends.
March 4: Ask R how her week was. She says it was "Kinda emotionally taxing" but
doesn't talk about it more. I ask her if she wants to grab lunch, and she's like
I'm swamped I'm a slug blah blah blah.
March 8: R hits me with the "can we talk" text. It starts with a snake emoji.
After I get this text I'm like "welp this relationship is over." I text a 
variation on that sentiment to matt. R and I arrange a time. She uses an
exclamation mark: "Oki!" Wow she is really excited to break up with me. This
is like peak R texting excitement. Maybe that's a good sign that we should break
up... Anyways, we meet by the turtle pond at 2pm. I suggested the time, she the
place. We have the usual greetings, how are you, good, how are you, good. 
We do not start conversations well. There's a warm up time of around 30 minutes
to an hour before the ball starts rolling. It doesn't roll that fast though. 
I'm writing this on March 15 (I wrote everything before this section on 
an earlier date) so I don't really remember the conversation that well. I
started off by asking her about her emotional problems she mentioned. She 
talked about how Kale took medical leave for his crazy pass-out migraines,
and how her friends in college are different than they were in high school. 
They're (all?) kind of depressed, and she helps them out, but she's probably
not the best person. Eventually she gets into the break up mode. Says stuff like
"I'm not in the right place for a romantic relationship," "You deserve better," 
"I'm sorry I've been so shitty," and I kind of just nod and say nothing like
a lame dog. She thanks me for being so nice about it (woopee). That part 
might have come later. Anyways, we walk around the southwest part of campus
and then circle back. I talk about LAZF and say "You're invited!" Woohoo.
I feel like everything said during a breakup does not count. But I did mean it.
Then I talk for a bit about Murakami. I forget that she's only read 
*The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles*. She says some stuff about how she should read more.
I think this is the default thing to say when someone starts talking to you
about books. Actually, everyone says this. We arrive at Ricketts. We dawdle
for a bit. Eric Mosely (that longboard dude) comes up. He forgot his key,
so R lets him in. She does this as I stand there with the mushroom plush in my
hand. Then I give it to her. She likes it! She's like [deep voice] oh where
should I put this idk i'll just stuff it in my pocket and take it everywhere.
We were just talking about how girls pants have no pockets and it sucks. Then
I'm like cya. And that's about it. Wow I wrote a decent amount on that.
