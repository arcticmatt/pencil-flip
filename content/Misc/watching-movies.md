Summary: Fanfare for Fandor   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In the summer of 2014, I watched a lot of movies. I
was working at Aspera, a small company in Emeryville. Due to the close
proximity to my house, I lived at home, and listened to more Volcano, I'm Still
Excited!! on my daily commutes than one can reasonably expect. On days when I
wasn’t hanging out with my high school friends, who were mostly still around
way back then, I spent a lot of time lying in bed from around 10pm to 12am
watching cinematic entertainment. I recall it being somewhat of a conscious
choice to watch movies; I usually watch a lot of TV, which is entertaining, but
can feel a bit wasteful. I feel much more accomplished after finishing a two
hour movie than after binging six episodes of How I Met Your Mother. Maybe it's
something about continually choosing to keep watching TV instead of doing
something productive, clicking to bring another episode up or simply lying
there as Netflix saturates my screen with hilarious mundanities. Or perhaps
it’s that a movie is a complete story, while TV episodes are, by design,
incomplete - meant to leave you wanting more. I don’t mean to crap on TV - once
you actually do finish a series, it serves as great talking material with other
watchers. You can bond over how much of your life you’ve wasted, stuff like
that. Anyways, back to the point. That summer, I was making a concerted effort
to watch movies. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This may seem unimpressive, like something any random
person can just wake up and do. But it’s not quite that simple. I had a plan. I
composed a list, which I would continually update throughout the summer. This
list was to contain movies to watch and movies watched. I named this list
“summer movies (2014 aka mumblecore af).” Examining this list, here are the
movies I watched:


Drinking Buddies   
Your Sister’s Sister   
The Puffy Chair   
The Five-Year Engagement   
the freebie   
in search of a midnight kiss   
breaking upwards  
frances ha   
audrey the trainwreck  
waitress   
the giant mechanical man   
yeast   
art house  
hannah takes the stairs   
starlet   
Happy Christmas  


I’m not the most reliable recorder, so this isn’t a complete list. Here are a
few other notable films I watched: 


The Deflowering of Eva van End   
The Indestructible Jimmy Brown   
The Strange Little Cat   
*German people share random life stories and thoughts with
relatives for 70 minutes. And it's awesome. Watch it!*   
The Rage in Placid Lake


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you’re a magical movie internet hipster wizard,
you might have noticed that many of these films can be found on fandor.com
(some of them only on [fandor.com](https://www.fandor.com/)), which is
netflix.com but weirder. It has short films, long films, silent films, erotic
films, user reviews on films, and all sorts of other cool stuff. It also has a
lot of mumblecore-ish films. The definition of mumblecore is kind of up for
grabs. It’s been said that Funny Ha Ha is the first mumblecore movie. I own the
DVD and have watched that movie twice, so I think I’m as much of an expert as
anyone to explain this genre. Mumblecore is kind of like what would happen if
you grabbed a 720p handheld camera, followed me around for a few weeks during a
period of my life in which there was some general resemblance of a romantic
relationship (may or may not be extremely difficult), did some minimal editing,
and burned a DVD of it all. In other words, mumblecore movies don’t really have
strong plots, or even set scripts. It’s just you watching some characters
interact in usually natural, often frustrating, sometimes flirtatious ways. At
this point you might be saying to yourself, “well that sounds boring as
\*\*\*\*.” I don’t disagree with that sentiment, and I don’t agree with it
either.  Mumblecore movies aren’t for entertainment, and they aren’t for the
(visual) aesthetic. They’re mostly a voyeuristic endeavour, a glance into the
private, mundane lives of a few semi-attractive, possibly unattractive people.
On a given night, this can be preferable; the story of a 20-something
struggling with friends (or lovers) and jobs and life-in-general (Funny Ha Ha)
might be more alluring than the story of some guys plotting against some other
guys plotting against some other guys and then everyone dies (The Departed). 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I spent many hours in bed with my laptop that summer.
There are few things more relaxing than sinking into a few pillows, snuggling
under the covers, and diving into a movie. The movie doesn’t even have to be
particularly good. I’m not advocating for watching bad movies, and certainly
don’t watch ones that actually annoy you (unless you’re into that kind of
thing, then go ahead). The thing is, movies have a special ability to suck you
into another world for an hour or two. That time is a free pass to ignore
everything else: phone notifications, emails, stray thoughts that maybe you
should really be doing \_\_\_\_\_ right now. Don’t ignore the urge to go pee though,
that thought’s important. Bodily excretions aside, for a brief time, you’re
free from obligations, distracted from worries. Of course, this “state” is not
unique to movies; you could say the same exact thing about reading, or watching
TV. But with those activities, it’s more tempting to switch activities, to
check your phone every 5 minutes. A movie is a perfectly allocated chunk of
time - long enough to fully unwind, short enough to watch and have an otherwise
fully productive day. That’s not to say that watching movies isn’t productive.
Movies can often inspire through ideas, images, music, or characters.
Connections can be made from movies to real life: learning-by-movie. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This summer, two long years later, I haven’t watched
quite as many movies. I have watched a lot of bad movies (all three Purge
movies). Still, if I want to unwind, I slump onto my bed, roll onto my
back, and throw on a flick.
