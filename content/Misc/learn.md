Summary: Making the bold assumption I learn something everyday

These short daily posts are fun. They provide, in a simple way, a timeline
of my everyday life, through all its ups and downs and dull mundanities.

### 3.13.2021
There are some oddly specific CSS color names. The full list is [here](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp). Here are some of my favorites:

- <span style="background-color: BlanchedAlmond">BlanchedAlmond</span>
- <span style="background-color: BurlyWood">BurlyWood</span>
- <span style="background-color: Cornsilk">Cornsilk</span>. Apparently this is an actual thing.
- <span style="background-color: MistyRose">MistyRose</span>
- <span style="background-color: PapayaWhip">PapayaWhip</span>
- <span style="background-color: PeachPuff">PeachPuff</span>
- <span style="background-color: RebeccaPurple;color:white">RebeccaPurple</span>

Here's a cool [blog post](https://chenhuijing.com/blog/where-did-css-named-colours-come-from/#%F0%9F%A6%8A) about how all these color names came to be.

### 3.12.2021
As a follow-up to yesterday: what's the difference between hyperthymesia, eidetic memory, and photographic memory? The [Wikipedia article for eidetic memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory) sums it up pretty well:

> Eidetic memory (more commonly called photographic memory) is the ability to recall an image from memory with high precision for a brief period after seeing it only once, and without using a mnemonic device. Although the terms eidetic memory and photographic memory are popularly used interchangeably, they are also distinguished, with eidetic memory referring to the ability to see an object for a few minutes after it is no longer present and photographic memory referring to the ability to recall pages of text or numbers, or similar, in great detail. When the concepts are distinguished, eidetic memory is reported to occur in a small number of children and generally not found in adults, while true photographic memory has never been demonstrated to exist.

To summarize:

- Eidetic memory: the ability to recall an image from memory with high precision for a *brief period after seeing it only once*. It's rare, but it exists.
- Photographic memory: the definition seems to vary depending where you look. In general, it's similar to eidetic memory, but applies to text and numbers, and the memories are more long-term. Its existence is debated.
- Hyperthymesia: described below! Hyperthymesia is longer-term than eidetic memory, and specifically about life experiences. It exists!



### 3.11.2021
Hyperthymesia is crazy. Here's the description from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymesia).

> Hyperthymesia is a condition that leads people to be able to remember an abnormally large number of their life experiences in vivid detail. It is extraordinarily rare, with only about 60 people in the world having been diagnosed with the condition as of 2021. There are generally two types, people that also remember the exact dates and times that each life event happened, and those that only remember every single life event in perfect detail without the exact dates and times.

### 3.10.2021
The beginning of ["A More Perfect Union"](https://genius.com/Titus-andronicus-a-more-perfect-union-lyrics) by Titus Andronicus starts like this:

> From whence shall we expect the approach of danger? Shall some transatlantic giant step the earth and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe and Asia could not, by force, take a drink from the Ohio River or set a track on the Blue Ridge in the trial of a thousand years. If destruction be our lot, we ourselves must be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men, we will live forever, or die by suicide.

This is adapted from [Abraham Lincoln's Lyceum address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln%27s_Lyceum_address):

> Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years. At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer. If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide.

Man, that's an awesome quote.

Yoshi's full name is T. Yoshisaur Munchakoopas. That's amazing.

### 3.08.2021
Here are two interesting papers about overlearning.

* https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED505637.pdf
* https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/uweb.cas.usf.edu/f3db157e6865f52ea1c6a9a798ef6ef3d90f20cc.pdf

Here's a definition of overlearning from the first paper.

> The immediate continuation of practice beyond the criterion of one perfect instance is defined as overlearning. Thus, if criterion is reached but further study is delayed until a subsequent session, the postcriterion practice is not an instance of overlearning. 

The first study tested the effects of overlearning on memorizing geography facts (city-country pairs) and word definitions. Let's just consider the geography fact experiment for simplicity. 130 college students were divided into six groups: (Lo, 1 week), (Lo, 3 weeks), (Lo, 9 weeks), (Hi, 1 week), (Hi, 3 weeks), (Hi, 9 weeks). Lo = not overlearning, Hi = overlearning. The time indicates when the students were tested on their knowledge. The study found that overlearning helped retention at the one-week mark, but not for the later dates. 

The second study tested overlearning and distributed practice for solving math problems, but let's focus on the former. For the overlearning experiment, 100 college students were divided into four groups: (Lo, 1 week), (Lo, 4 weeks), (Hi, 1 week), (Hi, 4 weeks). Again, Lo = not overlearning, Hi = overlearning. The study found that overlearning had no significant affect on test scores at either the one-week or four-weeks marks.

[https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition) is a really interesting article about spaced repetition. It references a ridiculous number of research papers. One of the more interesting ones is [Massed and Spaced Learning in Honeybees: The Role of CS, US, the Intertrial Interval, and the Test Interval](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC311375/). Here's the abstract:

> Conditioning the proboscis extension reflex of harnessed honeybees (Apis mellifera) is used to study the effect temporal spacing between successive conditioning trials has on memory. Retention is monitored at two long-term intervals corresponding to early (1 and 2 d after conditioning) and late long-term memory (3 and 4 d). The acquisition level is varied by using different conditioned stimuli (odors, mechanical stimulation, and temperature increase at the antenna), varying strengths of the unconditioned stimulus (sucrose), and various numbers of conditioning trials. **How learning trials are spaced is the dominant factor both for acquisition and retention, and although longer intertrial intervals lead to better acquisition and higher retention, the level of acquisition per se does not determine the spacing effect on retention. Rather, spaced conditioning leads to higher memory consolidation both during acquisition and later, between the early and long-term memory phases.** These consolidation processes can be selectively inhibited by blocking protein synthesis during acquisition.

Basically, they tested whether spaced repetition works for bees... and it does!

### 2.28.2021
The CAN-SPAM act is a law that establishes requirements for commercial emails. Here's some Q&A about it.

Q: When does it apply?</br>
A: It applies to commercial emails, i.e. emails with commercial content. There are three types of content an email can have. Commercial content advertises or promotes a commercial product. Transactional content "facilitates an already agreed-upon transaction or updates a customer about an ongoing transaction." Other content is neither commercial nor transactional. See [here](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business) for more details.

Q: What requirements does it impose?<br/>
A: The main requirement is that commercial emails must provide a way to opt-out of future messages. They also need to tell recipients where the sender is located. This is why emails sent with MailChimp, ConvertKit, SendGrid, etc., have an unsubscribe button and the sender's address at the bottom.

Q: What happens if you violate it?<br/>
A: Each separate email in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act is subject to penalties of up to $43,792.

Q: What does it stand for?<br/>
A: It stands for Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing. The acronym is a play on words—the act is supposed to "can", or put an end, to spam.

Q: Is it effective?<br/>
A: Not really. [In 2004, some surveys found that only 1-10% of spam email complied with the act](https://www.pcworld.com/article/114287/article.html). Further, the law does not require senders to get permission before they send commercial messages. Lastly, it overrides anti-spam laws enacted at the State level. Putting all this together, the law does not prevent people from initially sending spam (it just requires they provide a way to opt-out), and most spam emails don't comply with it.

*I found out about the [National Do Not Call Registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Do_Not_Call_Registry) while reading about this stuff. Maybe I'll write about that later.*


### 2.27.2021
With [github1s](https://github.com/conwnet/github1s), you can browse any GitHub repository with VS Code. All you need to do is append "1s" to a GitHub link, like [https://github1s.com/arcticmatt/dino-brick](https://github1s.com/arcticmatt/dino-brick).

### 2.25.2021

I recently learned about a note taking strategy called Zettelkasten. More about it [here](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125).

Here's an interesting quote from that article:

> [Lots of] studies suggest that nearly all non-linear note-taking strategies (e.g. with an outline or a matrix framework) benefit learning outcomes more than does the linear recording of information, with graphs and concept maps especially fostering the selection and organization of information. As a consequence, the remembering of information is most effective with non-linear strategies.

### 3.15.2020
I spent a large chunk of this weekend improving the performance of Porta Penguin
on Android. It already performed well on desktop (not surprising) and iOS (my iPhone is newer
than my test Android device, maybe that's why?). However, on Android, there were some
pretty glaring performance issues which really annoyed me. I hid a few of them by adding
scene transitions, but there was still visible lag, and the transitions weren't completely
smooth. The main things I did to improve performance are:

- **Disable as many collision bodies as possible**. Before, I did some optimizations to
disable off-screen collision bodies. However, I realized that things could only collide
on the left side of the screen, so I optimized this even more aggresively. This makes it
so that the game performs much better when there are more nodes on the screen.
- [**Change scenes manually**](https://godot-es-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/misc/change_scenes_manually.html).
This is super important, and makes it so that stuff is only a bit slow the first time.
For example, after I exit the Main scene, I save the node instead of deleting it. Then,
when the player navigates back to that scene, I just add that node back to the scene tree
instead of instancing an entirely new node (which is quite expensive). Doing this made my
scene transitions much smoother.
- **Reset scenes manually**. This is similar to the above. Instead of calling
`get_tree().reload_current_scene()` to restart the Main scene, which is expensive, I manually
reset the state myself. One big saving here is that the object pools don't have to get
re-instanced, which means all their resources don't have to be loaded and all their objects
don't have to be added to the scene tree.

</br>
Too lazy to record a video of the after now, but you can just download the game [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinyshroom.portapenguin) and see for yourself.

Also, it's great how easy it is to do screen recordings on Android using `adb`. I followed
[these instructions](https://medium.com/@elye.project/capture-picture-and-record-video-using-adb-5f4c582acb3c).

### 3.09.2020
```
int& getRef();
auto a = getRef();
```
`a` will just be a regular ol' `int`. Gotta do `auto& a = getRef()`. 

The rules for this are basically the same as the rules for template type deduction.
*Effective Modern C++* Item 1 has a good description of these rules.

### 3.08.2020
I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT4H0bstH8) about microcontrollers, or MCUs, today.
I'm not sure how accurate it is (probably simplified a lot of stuff), but the main takeaway is basically that 
an MCU is just like a regular computer (e.g. a PC) but a lot smaller and a lot more specialized. E.g. an MCU
has a CPU, it has memory, it has a system clock, and it has peripherals. However, it's a lot more resource constrained,
and will usually be used for some specialized application. Fore example, MCUs are used in key fobs, in traffic lights, 
remote controllers, ATMs, etc.

Also, apparently women's tennis shorts/skirts with pockets are not very popular. They usually just stick the balls between
their legs and a tight pair of spandex. Did not know that.

### 3.07.2020
[Google Domains](https://domains.google/) is so much better than Go Daddy, why didn't I know this 
before today? Go Daddy has a confusing UI, a subpar UX, and quite a few dark patterns. For example, it's 
so darn hard to simply check how much you're paying per year for all your domains. Granted, I haven't
tried to do this yet with Google Domains, but the rest of the process was so much better I'm just assuming this
will be too.

I used Google Domains to get [tinyshroomstudio.com](http://tinyshroomstudio.com/), which has a link to a Godot game
I exported for the web. While I was doing this, I found out that [threads don't work](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/getting_started/workflow/export/exporting_for_web.html) for these exports! This confused me for a while, because I was doing some [background loading](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/tutorials/io/background_loading.html). So that's one thing I learned today. 

Another thing, [websitepolicies.com](https://www.websitepolicies.com/) is good for generating privacy policies that are legal and 
no one will understand. They host them for you too, so you can link them when uploading apps to app stores and stuff.

Lastly... the native software on macOS is so bad for editing video properties like frame rate and resolution. Terrible.
Just gotta use https://video.online-convert.com/convert-to-mpg instead.

### 3.06.2020
Now that I'm doing these again, I'm starting to realize that the variety of things
I learn on a daily basis is much less varied than it was during college. Which, I guess,
makes total sense.

One interesting thing that's been going on lately are the presidential primaries. I'm 
not very educated about politics, so I've been watching some YouTube videos in my spare time.
Here's are two videos I found interesting:

* [The Trouble with the Electoral College](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k)
    * Apparently you can become president with only 22% of the popular vote. This is partially
  (entirely?) because each state gets 3 votes by default, even though some states should only
  get one by proportion.
    * In 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016, the president who lost the popular vote won the presidency.
  Might not seem like much, but that's a "failure" rate of >5%. Yikes.
* [The weird rule that broke American politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt4jHLteXag)
    * This video is about filibusters. Apparently almost every big bill is filibustered now. 
    * The Senate used to not have filibusters. Here's the rough timeline:
        * Originally, debate -> majority to stop debating -> vote
        * VP Aaron Burr changes things, debate (unlimited) -> vote
        * 1917, Woodrow Wilson wants to enter WW1, Senate filibusters. Now it's debate -> 2/3 vote to stop debating -> vote
        * 1950s, Southern Senators start filibustering a ton. Mike Mansfield is tired of long pointless speeches, let's get rid of the debate part. Now it's vote to stop debating -> vote
        * 1970s threshold is changed, now it's like 60% vote to stop debating -> vote
        * 2013, filibuster no longer applies to certain confirmation votes (vote to stop debating just needs 51%)

That ended up being kinda complicated. I'm definitely going to forget the history of filibusters. It's pretty interesting though. 

### 3.05.2020
Wow, it's been three years. A lot has happened. Let's think back:

* I graduated.
* I started working at Facebook.
* I started dating Katherine.

Ok, done. There's some health/job/friend/travel/etc. stuff stuck between the
cracks there, but who has time to write about all that. Let's get to the
important part: what did I learn today?

Well, the other day, I learned that [Let Me Alone by Moow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffzUBzrW9HA)
heavily samples [These Days by Nico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nGLqXZ-f70).
Both songs are great by the way. I found out about the former song first, but
the latter song seems much more famous.

Now that I'm working, there's probably going to be a lot of software stuff in these, assuming I actually keep writing them. Sorry to anyone who actually reads these (sorry future me). One cool thing I discovered at work the other day is that you can do stuff like this in C++:

```
enum class Handle : std::uint32_t { Invalid = 0 };
Handle h { 42 }; // Ok as of C++17
```
Yea, you can construct an enum with a value that isn't in the enumeration if you use list initialization! Kinda crazy right. You can read more about this [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum).

### 6.08.17
Woops.

I was listening to this [mixtape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4s-hxY80pA&t=132s)
today when I heard a familiar melody. Turns out Mac Demarco's
"Chamber of Reflection" samples Shigeo Sekito's "The Word II." Cool stuff.
On a sidenote, I've been trying to sample this [Vince Guaraldi song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5OKfC-JsS0),
but I've been getting a bit stuck. Maybe you can do better.

### 4.28.17
In order to procrastinate writing my essay, I'm finally updating this thing.
A [*tenso*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenso) is a style of troubador song in which two (or maybe more) poets
debate about something. A tenso is usually written by two different poets,
but sometimes the second poet is imaginary. Here's an example by Maria de
Ventadorn. I can't find it online so I'll just copy it.

> Gui d'Ussel, because of you I'm quite distraught,
for you've given up your song,
and since I wish you'd take it up again,
and since you know about such things,
I'll ask you this: when a lady
freely loves a man, should she do as much for him as he
for her, according to the rules of courtly love?

> Lady Maria, *tensons*
and all manner of song I thought I'd given up,
but when you summon, how can I refuse to sing?
My reply is that the lady ought to do exactly for her lover
as he does for her, without regard to rank;
for between two friends neither one should rule.

> Gui, the lover humbly ought to ask
for everything his heart desires,
and the lady should comply with his request
within the bounds of common sense;
and the lover ought to do her bidding
as toward a friend and lady equally,
and she should honor him the way
she would a friend, but never as a lord.

> Lady, here the people say
that when a lady wants to love
she owes her lover equal honor
since they're equally in love.
And if it happens that she loves him more,
her words and deeds should make it show;
but if she's fickle or untrue
she ought to hide it with a pretty face.

> Gui d'Ussel, suitors when they're new
are not at all like that,
for when they seek a lady's grace
they get down on their knees, hands joined, and say:
"Grant that I may freely serve you, lady,
as your man," and she receives them;
thus to me it's nothing short of treason
if a man says he's her equal *and* her servant.

> Lady, it's embarrassing
to argue that a lady should
be higher than the man with whom
she's made one heart of two.
Either you'll say (and this won't flatter you)
that the man should love the lady more,
or else you'll say that they're the same,
because the lover doesn't owe her anything that doesn't bear
love's name.

### 3.28.17
So if you do `ghc-mod check test.hs`, it's going to look at your 'user pkg db' (i.e. what results from `ghc-pkg list`). This means that, if a Haskell file imports a package that is not included in
base (e.g. `Data.List.Split`), you need to install that package with `cabal install` (the only
way a standalone ghc will find that package). `stack install` doesn't
work because [stack doesn't touch the global database](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31393189/why-doesnt-stack-add-packages-to-the-ghc-package-database)... remember,
it's just a project manager. This is probably very obvious
if you understand how all these things work already, but it took
me a bit to wrap my head around it all.

### 03.27.17
Algebraic datatypes are labeled "algebraic" because we can describe the
patterns of argument structures using two basic operations: sum and product. For example,

    data Example = First Integer String | Second

This is a product type because the first data constructor, called "First,"
takes two arguments. It is a sum type because of the pipe, which
means there are multiple data constructors (the type is a "sum" of these
possibilities).

### 03.16.17
[This is the best tab](https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/m/misc_computer_games/legend_of_zelda_-_lost_woods_tab.htm)
for Lost Woods (LoZ song) that I found. I tried a few so you can trust me.

Oh also, my friend matt alerted me of [blue-sky thinking](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blue-sky_thinking) today.
Basically means open-minded thinking. Nice little termerino for ya.

### 03.15.17
Clearly I have blog commitment issues. It's also finals week so I'll cut myself
a break. I'm finding it hard to think of something to write here. Either finals
aren't teaching me anything, or I've forget everything already, or it's all
too dull to remember. Maybe a combination of the three. Oh, I remember what I
was going to post a few days ago. It's an excerpt about the aesthetic of murder,
or more generally about the connection between beauty and horror (which happens to
be what I wrote my 10 page essay on). It appears on a handout from my Gothic
fiction class.

> I am for morality, and always shall be, and for virtue, and all that; and I
> do affirm... that murder is an improper line of conduct, highly improper...
> But what then? Everything in this world has two handles. Murder, for
> instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle,... or it may also be
> treated *aesthetically*,... that is, in relation to good taste... When a
> murder is in the [future] tense - not done, not even being done, but only
> going to be done - and a rumor of it comes to our ears, by all means let us
> treat it morally. But suppose it over and done...; suppose the poor murdered
> man to be out of his pain, and the rascal that did it off like a shot, nobody
> knows wither; suppose, lastly, that we have done our best, by putting out our
> legs, to trip up the fellow in his flight, but all to no purpose - why, then,
> I say, what's the use of any more virtue? Enough has been given to morality;
> now comes the turn of Taste and the Fine Arts. A sad thing it was, no doubt,
> very sad; but *we* can't mend it. Therefore let us make the best of a bad
> matter; and, as it is impossible to hammer anything out of it for moral
> purposes, let us treat it aesthetically... Something more goes to the
> composition of a fine murder than two blockheads to kill and be killed - a
> knife - a purse - and a dark lane. Design, grouping, light and shade, poetry,
> sentiment, are now deemed indispensable. **Thomas De Quincey: "a fine
> murder"** ("On Murder, Considered as One of the Fine Arts,"
1827).

Two notes. First: every time I read the word aesthetic, I think about vaporwave.
Second: did my professor type up all these himself? There's like three pages of
this stuff, and they have a bunch of ellipses. Maybe he got his secretary to do
it.

### 03.08.17
So much for updating daily. *Now* I'll start doing that.

[There's a difference between a mutex and a semphore!](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/62814/difference-between-binary-semaphore-and-mutex)
The main technical difference revolves around "possession." More
specifically, consider two threads running currently: TA and TB.
If TA locks a mutex, only TA can unlock. Thus, mutexes always look
like:
>     mutex.lock()
>     -critical section-
>     mutex.unlock()

Binary semaphores can also be used like this (i.e. a binary semaphore
can function like a mutex). However, with binary semaphores, there is
no concept of possession: if TA locks the semaphore, TB can unlock it.
Thus, it can be used for ordering, as follows:

>     TA                           TB
>     -*do something before TB-    sem.lock()
>     sem.unlock()                 -do something after *-

Also, on a related note, [The Little Book of Semaphores](http://greenteapress.com/wp/semaphores/)
is great. Doesn't explicitly talk about this difference though.

### 03.06.17
I had a cold last week, which is my excuse for not posting for a while. Also,
sometimes I just get lazy. It's not very rational, but certain days I'd rather
watch five more minutes of youtube than update this stuff. I'm going to try
to get back to daily updates in March. I like the idea of recording *something*
every day. It's fun to look back on, and putting stuff in writing can solidify
its place in my mind (perhaps I'll forget in a week instead of a day). Anyways,
enough rambling to myself. Here's a weird word that I think I read in
*Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World*.

>autochthonous : adj. : (of an inhabitant of a place) indigenous rather than
descended from migrants or colonists. (of a deposit or formation) formed in
its present position.

Also, just a random note about Murakami that I'll put here. I read *Sputnik
Sweetheart* while I was sick, and now I'm reading *Hard-Boiled*. I've read
*Norweigan Wood*, *Kafka on the Shore*, and *The Wind-up Bird Chronicle* before.
I definitely noticed some similarities between those books. However, with these
past two (or one-and-a-half) the similarities are really starting to hit. Here's
what I typed out in a message, with an edit in square brackets:

>after reading all these murakami novels they are starting to get pretty predicable.
kinda average dude with normal [but specific] habits who somehow attracts females
but doesn't really try. then there's a girl who he seeks after. then someone goes
missing.  there's probly a cat, important telephone calls, maybe a well (or at least a
reference to one). some sexually explicit parts.

For example, I was reading *Sputnik Sweetheart*. The plot, of course, involves
a missing women. The narrator is thinking of where she might be when he comes
up with a brilliant idea: she's in a well! Well, that sure came out of nowhere.
Turns out there are no wells on the island she disappeared from. I guess it
was worth a shot. And then *SPOILERS* there's the ending. I don't remember the
ending to *Norweigan Wood* that well but in my mind it's exactly the same.
Now, onto *Hard-Boiled*. The narrator is walking around a forest when he
comes across a house. What's in the backyard? You guess it - a well. Or maybe
the narrator just said "hmm a well would really fit in well with this exterior
landscape." I don't remember. But still... what's with all the wells? Did
Murakami have some scarring well incident as a child? Does he just really like
Batman? I don't know.

There's an entire subreddit dedicated eating to oranges in showers. I've never
tried it but the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/32jwie/whats_something_unconventional_everyone_should/cqbwlwi/)
makes it sound quite nice (or, to quote, the "most carnal, ferocious, liberating thing a man can do").

Blue Angels refers to the US Navy's flight demonstration squad. [It can also
describe the act of lighting a fart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fart_lighting).
Also, the term [intracolonic explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracolonic_explosion)
refers to an explosion inside a person's colon resulting from the ignition of
methane (and maybe other explosive gases). So basically, it refers to
internal/potential farts being lit on fire. It has resulted in death.

sole is covered in felt.  As a result, the tariff is reduced from 37.5% to 3%.
Jeff Steck, who is some dude mentioned in the linked article, calls
this "tariff engineering." Kinda makes me wonder if there are any other
weird classifications like this. If you coat an orange in rubber, is it now
a bouncy ball? If you put a hood on a cardigan, is it now a hoodie?

Also read some stuff today about Christina of Markyate and sexual chastity (*The Sexuality
of Chastity* by Karras). That book gives a pretty good description of Christina's
life, which I've copied below:

> Christina of Markyate, a twelfth-century Englishwoman, had vowed her virginity
to Christ. Her aristocratic parents, who wanted her to marry for political reasons,
went so far as to encourage her fiance to rape her. She managed to convert him
on their wedding night to a chaste marriage.

>Christina eventually ended up living as a holy recluse, maintaining her
virginity for her entire life, although the monk who wrote her biography seems
to have downplayed the spiritual significance of the state. In the process
she entered into passionate friendship with several men, including a hermit
named Roger and the St. Albans monastery. She lived for some time with an
unnamed cleric, and they were inflamed with desire for each other; only her prayers
brought her relif. Christina had not made a monastic profession at that point,
although she later did so. (page 55)

Victor is bros with the beard dude at Red Door. He even gave him one of our
beaver division shirts. He told me that the Red Door guy told him that
Joy Division (the band) is named after a Nazi concentration camp where soldiers would
go to rape the occupants. Doing some [quick googling](http://www.spiegel.de/international/nazi-sex-slaves-new-exhibition-documents-forced-prostitution-in-concentration-camps-a-459704.html),
it appears that these camps acted as incentives for non-Jewish concentration
camp slave laborers.

*House of Dolls*, a 1955 novella, coined this term. From Wikipedia:
>The novella describes "Joy Divisions", which were groups of Jewish women in the
concentration camps during World War II who were kept for the sexual pleasure of Nazi soldiers.

My bro kshit is at a big Indian wedding right now. He's keeping us updated
with a lot of interesting/funny/strange (to me) wedding traditions. One of them
is called **Joota chupai**. Here's what [Wikipedia says about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_wedding_traditions):

> It literally means 'hiding the shoes'. The bride’s sisters indulge in stealing
of shoes. It is a fun tradition, in which the girls charge a fee for agreeing
to return the shoes. They demand Kalecharis of gold for the bride's sisters
and of silver for her cousins.

So basically, the bride's sisters steal the grooms shoes and make him pay for them
(Wikipedia says gold and silver, but it's usually just cash nowadays).
Apparently, for the weddig kshit is at, this thing ended at 4 (I'm assuming AM)
and the dude paid 5100 rupees (~75 USD) because everyone was too tired to
negotiate.

I read *The Castle of Otranto* today. It's a pretty interesting book that fails
the Bechdel test quite nicely. In the introduction it says this:

> Accordingly, the Goths laid the foundations of culture - particularly of
literary culture. While Temple agreed that the Goths invented rhyme, he
placed this innovation within the powerful cultural context of literacy.
The Goths, it was imagined, wrote in a Runic alphabet comparable in the
development of written language to the Hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt. (xx)

I can't verify it on the internet (Wikipedia has contrasting information) but
I guess it's still slightly interesting.

I found this out a while ago but I guess I forgot to use it. In Ableton,
if you drag an clip into a midi track which has an instrument, it will convert
the audio to midi (if no instrument is loaded, the midi track turns into an audio track
and no conversion happens). Three options are given for the conversion: harmony, melody,
and drums. Harmony supports polyphony, while melody is a monophonic conversion.
The last option tries to pick up the percussive elements of the audio; if
the instrument loaded into the track is a drum rack, this type of conversion will
be used automatically. You can also right-click the audio clip to access
these conversions. Right-clicking also gives you the option to "Slice to New Midi Track,"
which converts slices of the audio into samples for a drum rack (these slices
can be set either automatically or with warp markers). All this info is available
in the [Ableton Reference Manual](https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/converting-audio-to-midi/).

I was reading this [article on theringer.com](https://theringer.com/the-great-j-cole-debate-31eb37c2a094#.rx6syvt5x) about whether or not J. Cole is good (his album came out today)
and there was an interesting thing about the Barnum effect. Shea Serrano
wrote about it pretty well and I'm pretty lazy so I'll just copy his words here.
It's a bit profane cause that's just the thug life so the censors are mine:

> Serrano: Do you know what the Barnum effect is? I learned, like, maybe five
things in college that stuck with me after I graduated. The Barnum effect is
one of them. The general definition of it is: "The observation that individuals
will give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that
supposedly are tailored specifically for them but are, in fact, vague and
general enough to apply to a wide range of people." It’s the reason that things
like horoscopes work. You read the horoscope, and it’s like, "Don’t ever cross
a Gemini because it’s very hard to earn a Gemini’s trust back once you’ve
broken it," and all the people who are Geminis are like, "Yup. That’s exactly
right. That’s so me." It feels specific, but it’s mostly applicable to anyone.
That is exactly what J. Cole is, and what he does. Take the J. Cole song
"January 28th" as an example. He says: "If you ain’t aim too high / Then you
aim too low." When you hear it while he’s rapping it, you’re like, "OK." But
then you think about it for, like, five seconds, and it’s like, "Wait … what
the eff?" I don’t think he’s actually relatable. I think he’s a familiar
version of relatable, which people confuse with the real thing. 5/20. ("You the
shiz only ’cause I digested you nignogs" — J. Cole, "See It to Believe It")

### 12.07.16
My friend kshit explained the surprise exam paradox yesterday, which is
summarized as the [unexpected hanging paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexpected_hanging_paradox)
on Wikipedia. I'll try to explain it here.

So you're taking high school chemistry, and your teacher tells you that you have
a surprise test next week. She tells you that it will either be on Monday,
Wednesday, or Friday. However, you realize that none of these days can be
a surprise. If the test is on Friday, then by Thursday night, you know
the test will be on Friday. So the test cannot be on Friday. Similarly, if
the test is on Wednesday, then by Tuesday night, you know the test will be
on Wednesday, since it did not happen on Monday and cannot happen on Friday.
The same logic applies to Monday. So you stride confidently into the week,
knowing that there can be no suprise test. The test then happens on Monday
and takes you by total surprise.

One (perhaps naive) explanation is that this is a second order surprise. The
teacher surprises you, the student, by defying your expectations. For example,
you assume that the teacher will not have the test on Friday, because then
it would not be a surprise. But then, in order to surprise you, the teacher
can put it on Friday. In that case, you wouldn't be surprised that the test
happened, but surprised that the test happened to happen (on Friday). Hopefully
that makes some amount of sense. If not go ask kshit to explain it to you.

It's finals week so these might get kind of boring, if that changes anything.
Modest Mouse has a song called "Sleepwalking" aka "Sleekwalkin'" aka
"Sleepwalking (Couples Only Dance Prom Night)" which appears on their *Interstate 8*
EP and their *Building Nothing Out of Something* compilation album. I never thought
about it before now, but that latter album name makes a lot of sense. Anyways,
the intro is a "cover" or adaptation of the similarly named "Sleepwalk" by
Santo & Johnny, a song from the 1950s that gets its memorable melody from a steel
guitar. More specifically, the sad little melody at the beginning of "Sleepwalking"
is basically exactly the same as the introductory steel guitar part in "Sleepwalk."
The loop that gets played through "Sleepwalking" also sounds kinda similar to the
bassline in "Sleepwalk," but it's not exactly the same.

An interesting bit from Susan Sontag's *Regarding the Pain of Others*:

> Something becomes real - to those who are elsewhere, following it as "news" -
by being photographed. But a catastrophe that is experienced will often seem eerily
like its representation. The attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001,
was described as "unreal," "surreal," "like a movie," in many of the first
accounts of those who escaped from the towers or watched from nearby. (After
four decades of big-budget Hollywood disaster films, "It felt like a movie"
seems to have displaced the way survivors of a catastrophe used to express the
short-term unassimilability of what they had gone through: "It felt like a dream.") (22 - 23)

just peel off like an orange or something. Jim the art teacher informed us of this
after we turned down the heat conveyer belt because it was slightly burning our

making the paint bond with the shirt instead of just laying on top of it (which

[This article](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/11/plight-of-the-funny-female/416559/)
about men not liking funny women is is pretty interesting. The three
main points I got from it are:

* Men try harder to be funny (make more jokes) which makes them
be perceived as funnier.
* "Women want men who will tell jokes; men want women who will laugh at theirs."
* Men can be turned off by a funny female. The experiment for this
sounds kind of weird though, so I'm not extremely sold on the evidence.

Fluxx is a game. It's hard to explain how to play, so you should just play it.
Just to give a little sense of how little sense it makes, it works a little like this.
The game starts with one basic rule: draw one card, play one card. Everyone
starts with a hand of three, and on their turn they follow the basic rule.
As the game progresses, new rules (type of card) and goals (type of card)
will be played, changing how the game is played and won. For example, a rule
might be "Play 3 cards each turn", or "Draw 3 cards each turn," and a goal might
be "You win if you have a sandwich and a friend." Stuff like that.

A few more details - the game is supposed to take 5-30 minutes to play, and
is supposed to to be played with 2-6 players. It usually takes longer the more
players are involved; the goals change more frequently against each player,
the keepers (good for winning, you'll get it if you play) are distributed more
widely, and there are just more turns to be played out. That being said, there's
not really a strategy to this game. It's so random and chaotic that any plans
you may have often get destroyed as soon as you start making them. That's what
makes it fun! Also, if you play with 7 players, it might take forever and annoy
everyone (depending on who everyone is). Perhaps this game actually was playtested.

[Set the Game](http://www.setgame.com/set/puzzle) is a thing. I had totally
forgotten this existed. It's a card game where you look for patterns. You can
also play online. The same company makes Quiddler which is also pretty fun.
But anyways, I'll briefly explain Set. The game is played by laying 12 cards
out in a 3 x 4 grid. There are 3 different shapes, 3 different colors, 3
different shading patterns, and 3 different numbers (for a total of 81 cards, meaning
each card is unique). For example, one card consists of a single-green-solid-squiggly
(number-color-shading-shape). The goal is to look for triples
where each characteristic is completely the same or completely different.
For example, three cards that are all green but have three different shapes might
be a valid triple. Whoever has the most cards at the ends wins. I played this game at
kath's house and lost very closely (out of practice).

A profile of Leo Tolstoy that I copied from my copy of *War and Peace* (Penguin,
Anthony Briggs):

> Leo Tolstoy was born in central Russia in 1828. He studied Oriental languages
and law (though failed to earn a degree in the latter) at the University of Kazan,
and after a dissolute youth eventually joined an artillery regiment in the Caucasus
in 1852. He took part in the Crimean War, and the *Sebastopol Sketches* that emerged from
it established his reputation. After living for some time in St Petersburg and abroad,
he married Sofya Behrs in 1862 and they had thirteen children. The happiness this
brought gave him the creative impulse for his two greatest novels, *War and Peace*
(1869) and *Anna Karenina* (1877). Later in life his views became increasingly radical
as he gave up his possessions in order to live a simple peasant life. After a quarrel
with his wife he fled home secretly one night to seek refuge in a monastery. He
became ill during this dramatic flight and died at the small railway station of
Astapovo in 1910.

### 11.19.16
Plumtree was a Halifax all-girl band. One day, Bryan Lee O'Malley woke up to
his morning alarm (a college radio station from the University of Western Ontario)
and heard one of their songs playing. He got really into them; he liked their
"funny and violent and moody and dark" lyrics, and found it cool that they were
only a bit older than him (still in high school at the time). He went to their
concert, and even got to hang out with the band a bit beforehand. Unfortunately,
his sister and her friend were only ~16, so they had to leave early. He apparently
still remembers the "searing guitar from the song 'Scott Pilgrim' blasting out the door"
as they left. And that's the song that inspired the graphic novels.

Michael Voltaggio is an American chef who currently lives in LA. He's
semi-famous because he won the sixth season of *Top Chef*. The head judge
of *Top Chef* has said: "Out of all the cooks that have come through the show,
Michael is the most talented - both from a sensibility and technical standpoint.
He has the chops to pull of what he's trying to do." MV has a two restaurants:
ink.sack, which makes small, cheap, "artisanal" (unusual) sandwiches, and ink,
which is a fancier "modern Los Angeles" restaurant right next to ink (like two
doors down). Here's the current menu for ink, which changes frequently.
![image](/images/ink_menu.png)
Note that they also have dessert, which is really good. I guess the dessert menu
is secret, because it's not listed on their website. The service at ink is great.
The food came quickly, and the server always prefaced the dish
with a quick description that went over our heads but sounded good and
fancy. We were probably served by around 5 different people throughout the
dinner. They recommended sharing and ordering all the dishes at once; I forget
what the reason was but I'm sure it's easier for them. There might be something about them ordering
the dishes in a certain way, although if you order a lot this probably
goes out the window. Anyways, we ordered 5 appetizers (1), 2 entrees (2),
5 sides (+), and 4 desserts (all of them). The delineation between appetizers
and entrees is kind of nonexistent. To get a complete meal, you need stuff
from both (1) and (2). (2) is more accurately classified as meatstuffs.
Anyways, one more interesting thing: apparently the hundreds (clothing company)
did a collaboration with voltaggio on a tee called the "sack adam."

A theophany is the appearance of a deity to a human. A famous example would
be God appearing to Moses as a burning bush. Another good example (not sure
how famous this is) pops up in the poem [*Andreas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_(poem)),
in which God disguises himself as a sailor. Under this guise, he captains a
boat for Andrew, and asks him a bunch of questions about Christianity and
God and things of that nature.

TIL of [water spouting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9r45O1eXtQ&feature=youtu.be).
It was made famous by this guy called Hadji Ali in his "human flamethrower" act.
For this act, he would drink a bunch of water followed by a bunch of kerosene.
He would then forcefully regurgitate the kerosene ("spout" it) to incite large
flames. Finally, he would put the flames out by spouting the water. David Blaine
learned this trick from a guy in Africa, and now uses it in some of his acts (see
the video linked above). Here's an [amazing gif](https://streamable.com/60n3)
that may or may not demonstrate the trick (it might just be sleight of hand or
something). It also has Steph Curry, Drake, and Dave Chappelle in it which is cool.

Some vi/vim things:

* vi is pronounced vee-I but no one actually pronounces it like that.
* vi was created by Bill Joy, who (of lesser importance) co-founded Sun Microsystems.
* vi was originally written as the visual mode for a line editor called ex.
* vi gets its name by abbreviating visual. Put into slightly more confusing but
more technically correct language, it gets its name from "the shortest
unambiguous abbreviation for the ex command `visual`, which switches the ex
line editor to visual mode." ex is the line editor mentioned above.
* vim = vi improved.

The [Wikipedia page for vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi), from which I stole
basically all this information, is very interesting. You should read it. And then
vim it. Don't geddit. Get it? Haha. I stole that joke from victor if he ever reads this.

Also, since that source is pretty unreliable, here's something that's actually
a thing. Bibliotherapy is, according to the *Online Dictionary for Library and
Information Science*,

> The use of books selected on the basis of content in a planned reading program designed to facilitate the recovery of patients suffering from mental illness or emotional disturbance. Ideally, the process occurs in three phases: personal identification of the reader with a particular character in the recommended work, resulting in psychological catharsis, which leads to rational insight concerning the relevance of the solution suggested in the text to the reader's own experience. Assistance of a trained psychotherapist is advised.

In a more basic sense, bibliotherapy is the use of books to help someone solve
their personal issues. The term was coined in 1916 by Samuel Crothers in an Atlantic
Monthly article, but the practice/idea has been around for much longer. The oldest
known library motto in the world is "the house of healing for the soul", and
Marcus Aurelius's physician maintained a medicical library in the first century A.D.
Was informed of this term by Kath (thanks ).

Boss Monster is a cool dungeon building card game. The goal of the game is to
build up a strong dungeon that attracts and kills heroes (so a bit of a paradigm
shift from the classic RPG). Each turn, you draw a "room" card which can be used
to add to your dungeon. Then, a few heros are drawn. Heros are distributed to
dungeons based on certain characteristics of the dungeons. If your dungeon kills
a hero, you get a point (first to 10 wins). Otherwise, you get wounded (5 wounds
and you lose). There are a bunch of other intricacies involving spell cards and
room types/effects and whatnot; suffice it to say that the game gets suprisingly
(but not overly) strategic as the dungeons start to grow. Lastly, can't forget
the awesome card designs - classic 8bit RPG goodness. Learned about this game
from Simon the Hag, and got it from Matt (thanks ~).

You can get awesome hand-crafted metal posters from [displate.com](https://displate.com/).
They're super easy to hang because they come with an adhesive magnet. You can

and 40,000 designs. They also plant 10 trees for each purchased Displate.

The title of the African novel *Things Fall Apart* is taken from the opening
lines of W.B. Yeat's poem ["The Second Coming"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43290):

> *Turning and turning in the widening gyre*
> *The falcon cannot hear the falconer;*
> *Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;*
> *Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world...*

Tangentially, here's a passage I liked from the novel. It's prefaced by Uchendu
putting Okonkwo's problems into context by telling him of even greater problems,
some of them personal. He ends his schpeal by asking if Okonkwo has heard "the song
they sing when a woman dies", which goes like this:

> *For whom is it well, for whom is it well?*
> *There is no one for whom it is well.*

This stuff is on page 135 (in my version).

Gustave Flaubert worked on a few books before the famous *Madame Bovary*.
Included amongst these was the first version of *The Temptation of Saint

of the reading, his friends told him to throw the manuscript in the fire, and
suggested that he write about day-to-day life instead of more fantastical subjects.

Ok, this tip is actually legit. I think I learned this a while ago and I forgot,
which I shouldn't have, because it's really important. You know those window
blinds, the ones made of a bunch of thin rectangles strung together than can
be rotated to block/not-block light? And then you can also just raise the whole
thing with a pull string? If you want to get the blinds to actually stay up,
you pull the string, and then when you release it, make sure the string is
perfectly straight. That is, make sure your hand, or whatever you're pulling
it with, is directly below where the string starts. If you want it to come
down, just pull the string and then give it slack when it's diagonal, or sideways,
or something like that.

In the original Old Testament (I think), Cain's sacrifice was put forward with
less good will than Abel's: "Abel, a generous shepherd, offered the fattest of
his sheep as an oblation to God. But Cain, a miserly farmer, offered only a
bunch of grass and some worthless seeds to him" (Wikipedia). However, in
the Old Testament Narratives (Old English Poems which I'm actually reading
for class), this detail is omitted. The entire recounting is quite sparse;
if I didn't know it was so important, I wouldn't think it was so important.

*Sic transit gloria mundi* - thus passes the glory of the world. Another
interpretation: worldly things are fleeting. It appears many times

in reference to the stafflike instrument used in such ceremonies.

There's also a really nice [Emily Dickinson poem](http://www.poemhunter.com/best-poems/emily-dickinson/sic-transit-gloria-mundi/)
which takes its name from this phrase.

Chronic nosebleeds can be treated in a variety of ways. Cauterization seems
to be a common one, in which a stick of silver nitrate is stuck up
the nose and used to "burn the ends of all the blood vessels". Nasal packing,
or the "application of sterile tampons to the nasal chambers", is another method.
Finally, if neither of these methods succeed, surgery may be necessary. The
patient is examined under general anesthesia and some type of surgical work on the
nose's blood vessels is performed to stem the bleeding.

(Attic nautia) "seasickness, nausea, disgust," literally "ship-sickness," from
naus "ship" (see naval). Despite its etymology, the word in English seems never
to have been restricted to seasickness.

### 10.20.16
Two kinda interesting things this morning. First, Post-it TM notes are
bad for books (so are similar brands of sticky notes). They [leave behind
a residue](http://www.library.illinois.edu/prescons/services/education_training/stickynotes.html)
which attracts dirt, makes pages stick together, or smears text,
even if notes are immediately removed. This isn't just anecdotal evidence:
the *National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)* conducted a study
on this stuff. Further, some notes are made of poor quality paper, which
can cause damage over time. Even further, some notes (not THE Post-it TM note)
use [poor quality adhesive](http://siarchives.si.edu/blog/post-it-or-not-post-it)
(butyrate) that discolors paper over time. Basically,
this is actually kind of complicaed, and simply put, sticky notes are bad
for books.

Also this stackoverflow post about [how to check if a directory exists and create
it if necessary?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/273192/how-to-check-if-a-directory-exists-and-create-it-if-necessary)
is quite good. It's a very simple question and then stuff starts to hit the
fan when blanket-catching `OSError`s as a workaround to a race condition doesn't
work, etc. etc.

Note:
I think the poor quality paper thing is probably lignin paper. Apparently

The *Psychomachia* is a poem by Prudentius written in the fifth century AD.
It's said to be the first and most influential "pure" medieval allegory.
The plot is pretty simple. There are some personified virtues (e.g. Hope, Sobriety,
Faith, etc.), and some personified vices (Pride, Anger, Avarice, etc.). All
the personifications are women, due to Latin word genders. The virtues and
vices duke it out one-on-one, with the virtues ultimately succeeding. Along
the way there are some Mortal Combat style fatalities, monologues about
stuff, etc. Psychomachia can also be used as a regular word to mean
"conflict within the soul", although it appears this is rare.

Found this [interesting interview](http://www.treblezine.com/out-of-the-bungalow-bon-iver-interview/)
of Bon Iver. Some notes:

* *For Emma, Forever Ago* was recorded at Justin's "little bungalow house in Eau Claire, Wisconsin."
However, he didn't go there for the purpose of recording an album. According to him,
he went there "out of necessity." Some background: during the summer of 2006, he
was dealing with mono and pneumonia. During this time, he also broke up with his
band, and subsequently broke up with his girlfriend. After he broke up with his
girlfriend, he continued to live with her while he worked on a record for
The Rosebuds (after he finished working on one of her records, for her band Nola).
He also had a bad liver infection. After he was done with The Rosebuds record,
he toook off.

* When he had everything all mixed, he thought the songs were just demos. But
after showing them to friends and getting good reactions, everything took off.

* About the process, he says: "I still, to a certain degree, will be insecure
always, but I think that I’ll continue to make records like this. I’m not going
to hire engineers; I’m not going to hire producers. I’m fully capable of doing
all that stuff, and I’m just going to keep it within myself, under my control
and surveillance."

A super beginner's guide to silk painting:

* Stretch silk onto some kind of apparatus. One kind of apparatus involves
rubber-banding a bunch of three-pronged forks around a wooden frame. The forks
then pierce the silk, and are used to suspend the silk in the center of the
frame. The shiny side should be facing upwards (this is the side you paint on).

* Apply gutta, which is a "resist." Basically, it's a gluelike substance that
prevents dye from reaching the silk, and can be used to guide the dye into
cool patterns.

* Let the gutta dry.

* Wet the entire shebang (with water). You can use a spray bottle, or run
it under a shower, or otherwise cover the fabric with water.

* Get some paint brushes and dyes, and start painting. If you're using strong
dyes, you might want to dilute them with water.

* Steam the thing. This binds the dye and the fabric together. I think you can
repeat the entire process with the dried fabric, but I haven't actually tried
it. Don't see a reason why you couldn't.

I think you can also wet it and then apply the gutta. It's not recommended but
it might do something cool (not sure, didn't try). You can also just skip
the gutta step entirely and just paint on some wet silk.

you draw it, you put it back. Each coupon is equally likely to be drawn.
What is the probability that more than *T* turns are needed to collect all
*N* coupons? Upon analysis, it can be found that the expected number of turns *T*
is *O(n* log*n)*. For example, if there are *N = 50* coupons, it takes, on average,

Christo and Jeanne-Claude were a married pair of artists who made environmental
art. For example, they put a bunch of umbrellas on hills, wrapped a bridge,
put a bunch of gates in Central Park, etc. Originally, credit was only given
to Christo (and even when I heard about Christo the other day, the name of his
wife never came up). It was only in 1994 that their works were retroactively
credited to "Christo and Jeanne-Claude." A cool thing: Christo and Jeanne-Claude
were born on the same day!

The Unicode consortium is a "non-profit corporation devoted to developing,
maintaining, and promoting software internationalization standards and data,
particularly the Unicode Standard, which specifies the representation of text
in all modern software products and standards." In its technical report on
Unicode Emoji (UTR 51), it proposes the following definitions.

> emoji - A colorful pictograph that can be used inline in text. Internally
the representation is either (a) an image or (b) an encoded character.
The term *emoji character* can be used for (b) where not clear from context.

> emoticon - (1) A series of text characters (typically punctuation or symbols)
that is meant to represent a facial expression or gesture such as ;-) (2) a
broader sense, also including emoji for facial expressions and gestures.

> emoji character - A character that is recommended for use as emoji.

A bike roller is a contraption used for indoor biking. It's composed of three

Imagine those vertical lines being sandwiched by two horizontal lines and you get the idea. Anyways, you can put your bike on this thing and ride in place; the back wheel goes on the sister cylinders and the front wheel goes on the solo cylinder. It doesn't seem extremely difficult, although keep in mind that my point of reference is a few

The Olympics have an interesting false start policy. It makes sense that "actual"

Olympics people also do calculations to ensure that no one is gaming the gun; that
is, they make sure that each person's reaction time is in the realm of possibility,
and that no one is *anticipating* the gun (and timing it just right so that
they start after it goes but "triggered" themselves beforehand).

Figs and wasps have a [co-dependent relationship](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/love-the-fig).
A wasp mother will bury into

the mother's wings get trapped, it cannot escape, and it dies in the fig.
This results in some interesting sentences in the [Defect Levels Handbook](

Traditionally, haikus contain:

* Some aspect of "cutting" (juxtaposition of two ideas).

* 17 on. An on is kinda like the Japanese version of a syllable, but
a bit different. For example, haibun contains 4 on: the elongated vowel gets
two and the "n" at the end of a syllable gets another.

* Some involvement of nature.

Typically, Americans butcher all or most of these properties. I guess we've
adopted our own kind of haiku, where we talk about random crap and our lives
and stuff (you're also not supposed to use "I" in haikus, but that's also
gone out the window).

>One pair of twins both suffered crippling migraines, owned dogs that they had named Toy, married women named Linda, and had sons named James Allan (although one spelled the middle name with a single “l”). Another pair—one brought up Jewish, in Trinidad, and the other Catholic, in Nazi Germany, where he joined the Hitler Youth—wore blue shirts with epaulets and four pockets, and shared peculiar obsessive behaviors, such as flushing the toilet before using it. Both had invented fake sneezes to diffuse tense moments. Two sisters—separated long before the development of language—had invented the same word to describe the way they scrunched up their noses: “squidging.” Another pair confessed that they had been haunted by nightmares of being suffocated by various metallic objects—doorknobs, fishhooks, and the like.

Anne Sexton was a confessional poet, a bit like Sylvia Plath both as a
person (perhaps a generalization, but note that they bonded over their shared
madness) and as a poet. Similarly to Plath, Anne battled depression and committed
suicide at an early age. There was a part of her that always wanted more: more
awards and accolades and affirmation. For a short period of her life, she
performed in her very own band called Anne Sexton & Her Kind. They experimented
with a variety of musical styles - bebop and jazz and country and folk - with
Anne Sexton providing the vocals. None of the songs are sung. Instead, they're
rhythmically read, in a way that differs from what one would expect from a
typical poetry reading. If you do want to hear Anne sing, her voice is
barely audible in the chorus of this [old live recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_gCY1qhUoE).

There's this really cool word,

But to avoid making this a dictionary, here's something else that might be of
slight interest. Devil tumors are *transmissible* tumors. They were first observed
on Tasmanian devils - researchers noticed tumors on these suffering creatures
were genetically identical, and realized that the cancer was jumping from one
devil to another. In simple terms, these animals transmitted the cancer by biting
each other on the face (a fairly regular behavior for them), an area which could
contain cancerous tumors. As Tasmanian devils tend to inbreed, leading to
relatively low genetic diversity, the tumors spread via this mechanism (as
opposed to being killed when transferred to a foreign host).

FILD, which stands for Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming, is a technique that utilizes
finger movement in an attempt to induce lucid dreams. The overall idea is
as follows. Go to sleep. Wake up ~6hrs later (should probably be in the
middle of REM?). As you're going back to sleep, which should be very easy,
perform an up-down motion with the index and middle fingers of one hand. That
is, alternatively press the index finger down (with the middle finger up), and
then the middle finger down (lifting the index finger up), mimicking the motion
used to repeatedly play two notes on a piano. Do this motion lightly, and focus
on it while going to sleep. The author of the thread says to perform a reality
check ~20 seconds after starting the finger movements; specifically, to pinch
the nose and try breathing in. I haven't yet tried this for fear of suffocating
but perhaps it is effective.

### 03.31.16
Copying large portions of these words from my friend Katherine because
I am lazy, ...
There are two major ways of looking at the meaning of words. The first
is the referentialist method, and the second is the internalist. According
to referentialists, words directly reference real objects. For
example, if someone is talking about a desk, a referentialist would say
they are "referencing" an actual desk in real life. On the other hand,
according to internalists, words refer to internal concepts. With this
interpretation, the concept of a desk may vary between different people.

Referentialists run into a problem when talking about fantastical characters
like Santa Claus. The sentence "Santa Claus treats his reindeers rather
poorly" makes sense, but from a referentialist standpoint, Santa Claus
should be referring to an actual, existing thing. In order to fix this
problem, referentialists say that Santa Claus does exist, but as an
abstract object (as opposed to a concrete one).

And so on...

In C, a static variable inside a function is locally scoped, but is changed on
a "global" level. For example, say we have the function

    void foo(void) {
        static int x = 0;
        x++;
        printf("x = %d\n", x);
    }

    int main(void) {
        foo(); // prints 'x = 1'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 2'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 3'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 4'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 5'
    }

This is neat. Note that static variables aren't stored on the stack or heap,
but instead are kept somewhere on the data segment or BSS segment (depending
whether the data is initialized).

which isn't actually true, posits that countries with McDonald's don't go to
war with each other.

### 02.22.16
HeLa is immortal! It also came about from a bunch of random factors (not all
cancer cells grow in culture). Bioethics is interesting.

### 02.21.16
My old math prof, Matilde Marcolli, does art. I didn't see it, but my roommmate
described it as "watercolor over math notes" - he saw her work on display at
Century books. I heard there are some matrix rotations in there.

### 02.20.16
People in Romania say "house of stone" when people get married. Roughly,
it means "good luck and strong marriage."

### 02.19.16
Emily Dickinson wrote about 1500 poems. Of these, around 10 were published
during her lifetime.

### 02.18.16
My CS144 set had a variant of the [pirate game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_game)
on it, which is a cool game-theory type brain teaser.

### 02.17.16
A study was done that found drunk people are more likely to push the
fat man (or route the trolley).

### 02.16.16
Ben & Jerry's is 5-10 times more expensive as some other ice creams (Lucerne,
Dreyer's, those other cheap ones). Per-X prices are handy.

### 02.15.16
After iterating through three Keegan facts, here's what popped out:
Kanye West and Kanye North are
[parliamentary constituents of Botswana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_constituencies_of_Botswana).

### 02.14.16
Pointer arithmetic on a `void *` is illegal in C and C++, but GCC allows it
(increments/decrements happen in byte size chunks).

### 02.13.16
Apparently, you can bike from Manhattan Beach to Manhattan Beach in about a month.

### 02.12.16
There's a synthesizer called Synplant where you plant seeds that grow into
synth patches; kind of like an organic, less numerical approach to sound. Found out
about it in this [Grimes interview](http://imgur.com/gallery/S9esf/).

### 02.11.16
I feel like it would be better if the information intake in my life were a little
more evenly distributed. It turns out that gravitational waves exist. Thanks
LIGO & Caltech & smart people. Also, 99% of all households purchase milk (source:
my friend Matt: source: random milk facts website).

### 02.10.16
Adolf Eichmann dabbled massively in the logistics of killing Jews. Another one
from *Kafka*.

### 02.09.16
A bildungsroman is "a novel dealing with one person's formative years or spiritual
education." I came across this term in *Kafka on the Shore*, a book (quite good
and weird so far) which uses it fairly frequently.

### 02.08.16
The Linux kernel switches schedulers a lot. The default scheduler right now
is the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). There's also a scheduler, created
as an alternative to the CFS, called the Brain F Scheduler (BFS). I feel like
profane names prophecy the inevitable non-mainstreamity of the namee, although
I guess the name could always be changed.

### 02.07.16
Indigo children supposedly possess special powers like talking to dead people and/or
God. They're named after the blue aura which supposedly surrounds them. I suppose
they could supposedly exist.

### 02.06.16
You can use Pyenv to switch between Python versions!

### 02.05.16
Victor, one of my housemates, got sick today. It might be norovirus, which
is apparently highly contagious and can be transferred by eating someone's
stool.

### 02.04.16
>All good things must come to an end.

The origin of this optimism? *Troilus and Criseyde*, a rollicking romance set
during the Siege of Troy. I Wikipedia'd the story today for no particular reason
(I read it last term for En121). Also, Criseyde is prounounced Chris-Aye-Duh. Or
at least that's the way it sounds nice to my ears.

### 02.03.16
Whilst writing a political science paper for some fun school stuff, I happened
across the following lines:
>At the discretion of the commander, soldiers were authorized one pint per day
[of beer] in garrison, and two pints per day in the field. Fresh ingredients in
the beer were thought to offset the likelihood of scurvy.

Images of melted-down Ben & Jerry's pints (with alcohol replacing swirled dairy)
come to mind. This stuff was found in *Redcoat Resupply!* by Major Tokar.

### 02.02.16
I (re)learned about a famous study that found guys are more likely to call an
attractive woman if they're scared of dying (fatal attraction?). They called
it "Some Evidence for Heightened Sexual Attraction Under Conditions of High
Anxiety." I read about it in Aziz's book. I also found out you can set
conditional breakpoints in GDB; kinda wish I had known that a bit earlier.

### 02.01.16
After a few mishearings (Pareto? frontal? prandial?), my friend Bogdan
(with his Romanian accent) conveyed to me the existence of the Prandtl number.
It's not very exciting.

### 01.31.16
I was informed about "the most infamous rhyme" in Middle English, which
appears in Chaucer's *The Canterbury Tales*.
>As clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queynte;
>And prively he caughte hire by the queynte,

My friend Sid, courtesy of Jennifer Jahner (a Caltech prof), told me this
chivalrous tidbit.

### 01.30.16
My friend Sihui sent me a picture of congee, which is rice porridge.
I'd only known it as jook before. Turns out congee is the more general
term for the dish.
