Summary: Making the bold assumption I learn something everyday

These short daily posts are fun. They provide, in a simple way, a timeline 
of my everyday life, through all its ups and downs and dull mundanities. 

### 03.23.16
The speedometers in cars have km/h as well as mph. Useful to avoid constantly
multiplying numbers by .62. I feel like this is something I have known, but not 
consciously.

### 03.22.16
Turkish deligh is "a family of confections baesd on a gel of starch and sugar."
The most legit flavor is rose, which I have never tried. Usually you see more
fruity flavors (e.g. mango, strawberry, etc.) but people also make more 
savory/non-fruity flavors, such as chocolate, almond, or coffee.

### 03.21.16
The Space Needle is 605 feet, or about 185 meters. Creepy game: pick a person
and follow them (with your eyes) for as long as you can. Weird observation: 
someone might be watching you at this very moment...

### 03.20.16
Portlanders sometimes refer to Portland (usually in text) as pdx. This abbreviation
also refers to Portland's airport. It's analagous to calling Los Angeles lax, or 
San Francisco sfo. I saw this used in various books, zines, and bumper stickers,
and confirmed its usage with my airbnb host, Heidi.

### 03.19.16
According to the "Zinester's Guide to Portland (5th Ed.)" and Wikipedia, 
Powell's City of Books is the largest independent bookstore in the world.
They sure do have a lot of Sylvia Plath books.

### 03.18.16
The FDA "alcohol line" stands at 0.5%. That is, any beverage whose alcoholic
contents exceed that percentage are marked as booze.

### 03.16.16
Amsterdam is known for its tulips, amongst other things.

### 03.14.16
Steph Curry's birthday is Pi day. Steph Curry's birthday is today. Today is
Pi day. Sadly, I ate no pie.

### 03.13.16
Was busy spending quality time with Pintos today so I kind of cheated and just
found this while browsing the front page of Reddit: 
[There are more doughnut shops per capita in Canada than anywhere else on the planet](http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-doughnut-unofficial-national-sugary-snack).

### 03.12.16
The income tax was first thought of in 1812 (war with England), adopted in 
1861 (Civil War), adopted again in 1894 (Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act), and finalized
with the 16th amendment.

### 03.11.16
"Google recommends LuminPDF as its third-party provider for seamless PDF editing."
Basically, you can open PDFs stored in Google Drive in the LuminPDF app, and then
mark them up (highlight, underline, strikethrough, insert text, etc.). I couldn't
actually figure out how to save the edited PDF back to drive, but I'm sure it's
possible.

### 03.10.16
In C, a static variable inside a function is locally scoped, but is changed on 
a "global" level. For example, say we have the function

    void foo(void) {
        static int x = 0;
        x++;
        printf("x = %d\n", x);
    }
    
    int main(void) {
        foo(); // prints 'x = 1'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 2'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 3'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 4'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 5'        
    }

This is neat. Note that static variables aren't stored on the stack or heap, 
but instead are kept somewhere on the data segment or BSS segment (depending 
whether the data is initialized).

### 03.09.16
AlphaGo (AI developed by Google's DeepMind team) beat the legendary Go player
Lee Se-dol, a seemingly big step forward for the field. Compare this to 
Facebook's [darkforest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkforest)...

### 03.08.16
The hard problem of consciousness can be phrased in the following way: "why do
qualia exist?" In other words, what accounts for the unique sensation of color
that people experience upon viewing the same night sky? This problem stands
in contrast to easy problems, which can be explained via mechanisms.

### 03.07.16
The supremum is the least upper bound. Maybe if I type this down I'll actually
remember it.

### 03.06.16
A zine containing Wikipedia lists (and lists of lists, and lists of lists
of lists, etc.) informed me of Sweden's Donald Duck Party - a joke party that
has been receiving joke/protests votes for years. At its peak, it was the 
9th most popular party.

### 03.02.16
Boba was invented in Taiwan. I feel like I might have known this already?

### 03.01.16
The psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott invented the concepts of "True Self"
and "False Self". "True Self" is the sense of self that comes from
"authentic experience", and a feeling of being alive. "False Self" is a facade -
the sense of self that arises when one, perhaps, is not completely comfortable 
and puts on an overthought front. 

### 02.29.16
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas managed to go ten years without speaking
during "oral arguments." He broke the streak by asking a question. This led
to the fantastic headline, **Justice Clarence Thomas breaks 10-year streak, 
asks question in court**.

### 02.28.16
Otto Plath was a really interesting guy. He "detested stock responses", 
and used to skin, cook, and eat a rat during his college classes. The so-called
"Bee-King", he used to follow bees to their nesting place and suck the honey
from the hive with a long straw. He had a seemingly mystical power over
bees; they never stung him when he caught them, and he once caught a bee in his fist
and held it to his young daughter's ear.

### 02.26.16
Kafka never finished *The Castle*.

### 02.25.16
Did you know that nose whistles exist?

### 02.24.16
"I Wandered Lonley as a Cloud" is a happy poem by William Woodsworth (thanks
Katherine).

### 02.23.16
The [McDonald's theory of war](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/06/russia.mcdonalds),
which isn't actually true, posits that countries with McDonald's don't go to
war with each other.

### 02.22.16
HeLa is immortal! It also came about from a bunch of random factors (not all
cancer cells grow in culture). Bioethics is interesting.

### 02.21.16
My old math prof, Matilde Marcolli, does art. I didn't see it, but my roommmate
described it as "watercolor over math notes" - he saw her work on display at
Century books. I heard there are some matrix rotations in there. 

### 02.20.16
People in Romania say "house of stone" when people get married. Roughly,
it means "good luck and strong marriage." 

### 02.19.16
Emily Dickinson wrote about 1500 poems. Of these, around 10 were published
during her lifetime.

### 02.18.16
My CS144 set had a variant of the [pirate game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_game)
on it, which is a cool game-theory type brain teaser. 

### 02.17.16
A study was done that found drunk people are more likely to push the
fat man (or route the trolley).

### 02.16.16
Ben & Jerry's is 5-10 times more expensive as some other ice creams (Lucerne, 
Dreyer's, those other cheap ones). Per-X prices are handy.

### 02.15.16
After iterating through three Keegan facts, here's what popped out:
Kanye West and Kanye North are 
[parliamentary constituents of Botswana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_constituencies_of_Botswana).

### 02.14.16
Pointer arithmetic on a `void *` is illegal in C and C++, but GCC allows it 
(increments/decrements happen in byte size chunks). 

### 02.13.16
Apparently, you can bike from Manhattan Beach to Manhattan Beach in about a month.

### 02.12.16
There's a synthesizer called Synplant where you plant seeds that grow into
synth patches; kind of like an organic, less numerical approach to sound. Found out
about it in this [Grimes interview](http://imgur.com/gallery/S9esf/).

### 02.11.16
I feel like it would be better if the information intake in my life were a little
more evenly distributed. It turns out that gravitational waves exist. Thanks
LIGO & Caltech & smart people. Also, 99% of all households purchase milk (source:
my friend Matt: source: random milk facts website).

### 02.10.16
Adolf Eichmann dabbled massively in the logistics of killing Jews. Another one
from *Kafka*.

### 02.09.16
A bildungsroman is "a novel dealing with one person's formative years or spiritual 
education." I came across this term in *Kafka on the Shore*, a book (quite good
and weird so far) which uses it fairly frequently.

### 02.08.16
The Linux kernel switches schedulers a lot. The default scheduler right now
is the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). There's also a scheduler, created 
as an alternative to the CFS, called the Brain F Scheduler (BFS). I feel like
profane names prophecy the inevitable non-mainstreamity of the namee, although
I guess the name could always be changed.

### 02.07.16
Indigo children supposedly possess special powers like talking to dead people and/or
God. They're named after the blue aura which supposedly surrounds them. I suppose
they could supposedly exist.

### 02.06.16
You can use Pyenv to switch between Python versions!

### 02.05.16
Victor, one of my housemates, got sick today. It might be norovirus, which 
is apparently highly contagious and can be transferred by eating someone's 
stool. 

### 02.04.16
>All good things must come to an end.

The origin of this optimism? *Troilus and Criseyde*, a rollicking romance set 
during the Siege of Troy. I Wikipedia'd the story today for no particular reason 
(I read it last term for En121). Also, Criseyde is prounounced Chris-Aye-Duh. Or 
at least that's the way it sounds nice to my ears.

### 02.03.16
Whilst writing a political science paper for some fun school stuff, I happened
across the following lines:
>At the discretion of the commander, soldiers were authorized one pint per day 
[of beer] in garrison, and two pints per day in the field. Fresh ingredients in 
the beer were thought to offset the likelihood of scurvy.

Images of melted-down Ben & Jerry's pints (with alcohol replacing swirled dairy) 
come to mind. This stuff was found in *Redcoat Resupply!* by Major Tokar.

### 02.02.16
I (re)learned about a famous study that found guys are more likely to call an
attractive woman if they're scared of dying (fatal attraction?). They called 
it "Some Evidence for Heightened Sexual Attraction Under Conditions of High 
Anxiety." I read about it in Aziz's book. I also found out you can set 
conditional breakpoints in GDB; kinda wish I had known that a bit earlier.

### 02.01.16
After a few mishearings (Pareto? frontal? prandial?), my friend Bogdan 
(with his Romanian accent) conveyed to me the existence of the Prandtl number. 
It's not very exciting.

### 01.31.16
I was informed about "the most infamous rhyme" in Middle English, which
appears in Chaucer's *The Canterbury Tales*.
>As clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queynte;  
>And prively he caughte hire by the queynte,

My friend Sid, courtesy of Jennifer Jahner (a Caltech prof), told me this
chivalrous tidbit. 

### 01.30.16
My friend Sihui sent me a picture of congee, which is rice porridge.
I'd only known it as jook before. Turns out congee is the more general
term for the dish.
