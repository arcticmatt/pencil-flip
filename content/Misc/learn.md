Summary: Making the bold assumption I learn something everyday

These short daily posts are fun. They provide, in a simple way, a timeline 
of my everyday life, through all its ups and downs and dull mundanities. 

### 11.07.16  
Sometimes I can't think of anything interesting.

> blackamoor : noun : a dark-skinned person; *especially* : black

I found this word in a Tintin book. I think Captain Haddock used it as 
an insult (in a possibly racially offensive context). Not recommended for 
real-world usage.

### 11.06.16  
The title of the African novel *Things Fall Apart* is taken from the opening 
lines of W.B. Yeat's poem ["The Second Coming"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43290):

> *Turning and turning in the widening gyre*  
> *The falcon cannot hear the falconer;*  
> *Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;*  
> *Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world...*  

Tangentially, here's a passage I liked from the novel. It's prefaced by Uchendu
putting Okonkwo's problems into context by telling him of even greater problems,
some of them personal. He ends his schpeal by asking if Okonkwo has heard "the song
they sing when a woman dies", which goes like this:

> *For whom is it well, for whom is it well?*  
> *There is no one for whom it is well.*  

This stuff is on page 135 (in my version).

### 11.05.16  
Gustave Flaubert worked on a few books before the famous *Madame Bovary*. 
Included amongst these was the first version of *The Temptation of Saint
Anthony*. He read the novel out loud to two friends over four days, and told 
them to keep down any interruptions or opinions during that time. At the end
of the reading, his friends told him to throw the manuscript in the fire, and 
suggested that he write about day-to-day life instead of more fantastical subjects.

### 11.04.16  
[Caffeine toxicity](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/821863-overview) is a 
thing. Overdosing on caffeine ("ingesting in excessive amounts
for extended periods") can result in headaches, agitation, seizures,
chest pain, nausea, and more.

### 11.03.16  
You should read some books faster than you think (Kant).  
You should read some books slower than you think (Hume, *Things Fall Apart*).

### 11.02.16  
> bluestocking : noun (derogatory) : an intellectual or literary woman.

Found in *War and Peace*.

### 11.01.16  
On a mac, `option-shift-(volume up/down)` to adjust the volume by quarter
increments.

### 10.30.16  
Cotton swabs were invented in the 1920s by this guy named Leo Gerstenzang. He
got inspiration from watching his wife apply cotton wads to toothpicks in order
to clean specific areas. He named his product *Baby Gays*. He later changed 
this to *Q-Tips Baby Gays* (Q for quality), which then got shortened again to just
*Q-Tips*.

### 10.29.16  
Ok, this tip is actually legit. I think I learned this a while ago and I forgot,
which I shouldn't have, because it's really important. You know those window 
blinds, the ones made of a bunch of thin rectangles strung together than can
be rotated to block/not-block light? And then you can also just raise the whole
thing with a pull string? If you want to get the blinds to actually stay up,
you pull the string, and then when you release it, make sure the string is 
perfectly straight. That is, make sure your hand, or whatever you're pulling
it with, is directly below where the string starts. If you want it to come 
down, just pull the string and then give it slack when it's diagonal, or sideways,
or something like that.

### 10.28.16  
On mac, type `option-shift-k` and get . Google search this and whaddya know,
www.apple.com is the first result. That's kinda cool. 

### 10.27.16  
[Youtube keyboard shortcuts for ya](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/going-google/accessibility/google-keyboard-shortcuts---youtube).
Some notable ones:

`k/spacebar` - play/pause
`left arrow` - rewind 5 seconds
`right arrow` - fast forward 5 seconds
`j` - rewind 10 seconds
`l` - fast forward 10 seconds
`0` - restart video
`f` - toggle full screen

### 10.26.16  
[www.tscapparel.com](http://www.tscapparel.com//) sells cheap clothes stuff "for the sole purpose of resale". Here's their official schpeal:
> TSC is a distributor of blank apparel and accessories. We only sell to licensed 
> screen printers, embroiderers, decorators, and members of the promotional products 
> industry for the sole purpose of resale. 

Here are some t-shirt models/prices that Caltech uses for silkscreening:

### 10.25.16  
In the original Old Testament (I think), Cain's sacrifice was put forward with 
less good will than Abel's: "Abel, a generous shepherd, offered the fattest of 
his sheep as an oblation to God. But Cain, a miserly farmer, offered only a 
bunch of grass and some worthless seeds to him" (Wikipedia). However, in
the Old Testament Narratives (Old English Poems which I'm actually reading
for class), this detail is omitted. The entire recounting is quite sparse; 
if I didn't know it was so important, I wouldn't think it was so important.

### 10.24.16  
*Sic transit gloria mundi* - thus passes the glory of the world. Another
interpretation: worldly things are fleeting. It appears many times 
in pop culture (see Wikipedia), and used to be used in the ritual of 
"papal coronation ceremonies" (crowning the pope). The phrase can also be used
in reference to the stafflike instrument used in such ceremonies. 

There's also a really nice [Emily Dickinson poem](http://www.poemhunter.com/best-poems/emily-dickinson/sic-transit-gloria-mundi/)
which takes its name from this phrase.

> "Sic transit gloria mundi,"  
> "How doth the busy bee,"  
> "Dum vivimus vivamus,"  
> I stay mine enemy!   

### 10.23.16  
Chronic nosebleeds can be treated in a variety of ways. Cauterization seems 
to be a common one, in which a stick of silver nitrate is stuck up 
the nose and used to "burn the ends of all the blood vessels". Nasal packing,
or the "application of sterile tampons to the nasal chambers", is another method.
Finally, if neither of these methods succeed, surgery may be necessary. The
patient is examined under general anesthesia and some type of surgical work on the 
nose's blood vessels is performed to stem the bleeding.

### 10.22.16  
> plash : noun : splash.

Found in *War and Peace*. 

### 10.21.16  
Etymology of [nausea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JidJV1ue1lI) (comes from the Greek work *naus* for ship).

> early 15c., vomiting, from Latin nausea "seasickness," from Ionic Greek nausia 
(Attic nautia) "seasickness, nausea, disgust," literally "ship-sickness," from 
naus "ship" (see naval). Despite its etymology, the word in English seems never 
to have been restricted to seasickness.

### 10.20.16  
Two kinda interesting things this morning. First, Post-it TM notes are 
bad for books (so are similar brands of sticky notes). They [leave behind 
a residue](http://www.library.illinois.edu/prescons/services/education_training/stickynotes.html)
which attracts dirt, makes pages stick together, or smears text,
even if notes are immediately removed. This isn't just anecdotal evidence:
the *National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)* conducted a study
on this stuff. Further, some notes are made of poor quality paper, which 
can cause damage over time. Even further, some notes (not THE Post-it TM note)
use [poor quality adhesive](http://siarchives.si.edu/blog/post-it-or-not-post-it) 
(butyrate) that discolors paper over time. Basically,
this is actually kind of complicaed, and simply put, sticky notes are bad
for books.

Also this stackoverflow post about [how to check if a directory exists and create
it if necessary?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/273192/how-to-check-if-a-directory-exists-and-create-it-if-necessary)
is quite good. It's a very simple question and then stuff starts to hit the 
fan when blanket-catching `OSError`s as a workaround to a race condition doesn't
work, etc. etc. 

Note:  
I think the poor quality paper thing is probably lignin paper. Apparently 
[lignin reacts with light](http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/maravilla/deterioration-causes.html)
and causes coloration. 

### 10.19.16  
There are white guavas and pink guavas. Pink guavas get their color from an
organic pigment called carotenoid. The white guava I ate tasted kind of like 
a kiwi, but less sweet. This assessment may or may not be completely 
non-representative of the average white-guava-eating-experience.

### 10.18.16  
Lobsters aren't immortal, they just have negligible senescence. Basically,
when they die, it's not by gradual processes. Think I posted about 
senescence some time ago.

### 10.17.16  
There are `const` functions in C++. Only member methods should be labeled 
as `const`, since they are used to make the function (implicitly) take 
a `const` "this" pointer. In other words, a `const` function cannot modify 
the object it's called on. Note that 

* `const` functions can always be called

* non-`const` functions can only be called by non-`const` objects

### 10.16.16    
Etmyologically, the words "niggard" and "nigg^%" are unrelated. However, there 
have been so many controversies about the word "niggard" that there is a [Wikipedia
page about these controversies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_about_the_word_%22niggardly%22).
One of these issues has led to a "national debate in the U.S." over whether the 
word should be avoided.

### 10.14.16    
Elementary row operations do not change the row space of a matrix. This means 
that, given matrix `A`, `rowspace(A) == rowspace(rref(A))`. Another trick for 
finding the row space of a matrix is to find the column space of the transpose
of A. 

### 10.13.16    
The *Psychomachia* is a poem by Prudentius written in the fifth century AD.
It's said to be the first and most influential "pure" medieval allegory. 
The plot is pretty simple. There are some personified virtues (e.g. Hope, Sobriety,
Faith, etc.), and some personified vices (Pride, Anger, Avarice, etc.). All
the personifications are women, due to Latin word genders. The virtues and 
vices duke it out one-on-one, with the virtues ultimately succeeding. Along 
the way there are some Mortal Combat style fatalities, monologues about 
stuff, etc. Psychomachia can also be used as a regular word to mean 
"conflict within the soul", although it appears this is rare.

### 10.12.16    
Some good stuff on Unicode, specifically related to its use in software:

* [Ned Batchelder](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/unipain.html)

* [Joel](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html)
 
* [farmdev](http://farmdev.com/talks/unicode/)

Now, since I'm to lazy to regurgitate any of that information, I'll instead
steal from this [great askreddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/top/?sort=top&t=week)
about pleasant and uplifting facts.   
Maurice Sendak, the author of 
*Where the Wild Things Are*, once replied to a child's letter with
a letter and a sketch. The child's mom wrote back to Maurice and told him
her son loved the letter so much that he ate it.   
Did you know there are more public libraries than McDonalds in the US?  
This is actually mindblowing: the voice actor of Spongebob is married to the voice
actor of Plankton's computer wife.  

### 10.11.16    
Too lazy to write about the Canada Commando/Kanada Kommando/Kanadakommando so I'll
just do this.

>sangfroid : noun : the ability to stay calm in difficult or dangerous situations.

He played that game where you stab a sharp thing between your fingers with 
remarkable sangfroid. 

### 10.10.16    
Ben Saltzman (currently a "Weisman Postdoctoral Instructor in Medieval British Literature"
at Caltech) pointed out this specific passage to our English class:

> The world rings its regular changes,  
> its elements reconciled  
> held in balance in their battle  
> by its immutable laws.  
> Phoebus comes on with rosy dawns  
> in his flying golden car,  
> and Phoebe brings the silver moon,  
> fulfilling Hesperus' promise.  
> The churning sea is confined to its bed  
> and the land keeps to its bounds,  
> for each is subject to a greater power  
> the other helps to enforce.  
> What governs earth and sea and sky  
> is nothing less than love,  
> whose tight rein if it ever slackened  
> would leave creation in chaos  
> of civil war's utter ruin.  
> Love binds people too,  
> in matrimony's sacred bonds  
> where chaste lovers are met,  
> and friends cement their trust and friendship.  
> How happy is mankind,  
> if the love that orders the stars above  
> rules, too, in your hearts. (57-58, Boethius, The Consolation of Philosophy)

Good to read at weddings and casual dinner parties and stuff. 

### 10.09.16    
Found this [interesting interview](http://www.treblezine.com/out-of-the-bungalow-bon-iver-interview/)
of Bon Iver. Some notes:

* *For Emma, Forever Ago* was recorded at Justin's "little bungalow house in Eau Claire, Wisconsin."
However, he didn't go there for the purpose of recording an album. According to him,
he went there "out of necessity." Some background: during the summer of 2006, he 
was dealing with mono and pneumonia. During this time, he also broke up with his 
band, and subsequently broke up with his girlfriend. After he broke up with his
girlfriend, he continued to live with her while he worked on a record for 
The Rosebuds (after he finished working on one of her records, for her band Nola).
He also had a bad liver infection. After he was done with The Rosebuds record,
he toook off.

* When he had everything all mixed, he thought the songs were just demos. But 
after showing them to friends and getting good reactions, everything took off.

* About the process, he says: "I still, to a certain degree, will be insecure 
always, but I think that I’ll continue to make records like this. I’m not going 
to hire engineers; I’m not going to hire producers. I’m fully capable of doing 
all that stuff, and I’m just going to keep it within myself, under my control 
and surveillance."

### 10.08.16    
The column rank of a matrix *A* is the maximal number of linearly independent columns,
which is equivalent to the dimension of the column space of *A* (space spanned
by the columns).   
The row rank of a matrix *A* is the maximal number of linearly independent rows,
which is equivalent to the dimension of the row space of *A*.    
For any matrix *A*, the column rank and row rank are always equal.  

### 10.07.16    
*Bon hiver* is a French phrase meaning "good winter", from which the 
band Bon Iver derives its namesake.

### 10.06.16    
Conditional probability, Kolmogorov definition: `P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)`  
Bayes' theorem: `P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A) / P(B)`  
I didn't actually learn this stuff today/yesterday but it was relevant  
b/c grading. 

### 10.05.16    
It's a trap!

> Truffle oil is controversial as a flavoring ingredient, as most truffle oil is 
artificially produced and may lack the flavors or complexities of fresh 
truffles. (Wikipedia)

### 10.04.16    
A super beginner's guide to silk painting:

* Stretch silk onto some kind of apparatus. One kind of apparatus involves
rubber-banding a bunch of three-pronged forks around a wooden frame. The forks
then pierce the silk, and are used to suspend the silk in the center of the 
frame. The shiny side should be facing upwards (this is the side you paint on).

* Apply gutta, which is a "resist." Basically, it's a gluelike substance that
prevents dye from reaching the silk, and can be used to guide the dye into 
cool patterns. 

* Let the gutta dry.

* Wet the entire shebang (with water). You can use a spray bottle, or run 
it under a shower, or otherwise cover the fabric with water.

* Get some paint brushes and dyes, and start painting. If you're using strong
dyes, you might want to dilute them with water. 

* Steam the thing. This binds the dye and the fabric together. I think you can
repeat the entire process with the dried fabric, but I haven't actually tried 
it. Don't see a reason why you couldn't.

I think you can also wet it and then apply the gutta. It's not recommended but
it might do something cool (not sure, didn't try). You can also just skip 
the gutta step entirely and just paint on some wet silk. 

### 10.03.16    
Found this cool [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/55hva4/disney_recycles_animation_when_they_are_on_a_time/)
the other day, which shows how Disney reuses animation when they're stretched
for time. In other words, a lot of their older movies have scenes that use 
the exact same movements, albeit with different characters. The movie linked
in the link shows it much better than I can explain it. 

### 10.02.16    
The Double ShackBurger at Shake Shack (cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes,
Shack sauce) costs $8.09 at the West Hollywood location at the time this is 
being written. Compare this to a Double-Double at In-N-Out, which currently 
costs $3.60. Author's note: the ShackBurger is *delicious*.

### 10.01.16    
The coupon collector's problem goes as follows. There is a jar with *N* unique
coupons. You are a collector. Each turn, you draw one coupon from the jar; after
you draw it, you put it back. Each coupon is equally likely to be drawn. 
What is the probability that more than *T* turns are needed to collect all 
*N* coupons? Upon analysis, it can be found that the expected number of turns *T*
is *O(n* log*n)*. For example, if there are *N = 50* coupons, it takes, on average,
*225* turns to collect all the coupons.

### 09.30.16    
"Demosthenes, I know you by the pebble in your golden mouth!" - page 167 of 
*War and Peace*. Demosthenes was a Greek orator who, according to legend, practiced 
speaking with stones in his mouth. He also recited verses while running and strengthened
his voice by speaking on the seashore over the roar of the waves, according to
Wikipedia.

### 09.29.16    
PAC stands for probably approximately correct, e.g. Hoeffding's inequality gives
us a PAC equality. PAC learning is a framework for mathematical analysis of 
machine learning.

### 09.28.16    
`Boysenberry = European raspberry x European blackberry x American dewberry x Loganberry`

Random fact from Wikipedia: New Zealand is the "largest marketer of boysenberries worldwide."

### 09.27.16    
Christo and Jeanne-Claude were a married pair of artists who made environmental
art. For example, they put a bunch of umbrellas on hills, wrapped a bridge, 
put a bunch of gates in Central Park, etc. Originally, credit was only given 
to Christo (and even when I heard about Christo the other day, the name of his 
wife never came up). It was only in 1994 that their works were retroactively 
credited to "Christo and Jeanne-Claude." A cool thing: Christo and Jeanne-Claude
were born on the same day!

### 09.26.16    
The Unicode consortium is a "non-profit corporation devoted to developing, 
maintaining, and promoting software internationalization standards and data, 
particularly the Unicode Standard, which specifies the representation of text 
in all modern software products and standards." In its technical report on
Unicode Emoji (UTR 51), it proposes the following definitions. 

> emoji - A colorful pictograph that can be used inline in text. Internally
the representation is either (a) an image or (b) an encoded character. 
The term *emoji character* can be used for (b) where not clear from context.

> emoticon - (1) A series of text characters (typically punctuation or symbols) 
that is meant to represent a facial expression or gesture such as ;-) (2) a 
broader sense, also including emoji for facial expressions and gestures.

> emoji character - A character that is recommended for use as emoji.

### 09.25.16    
Screen printing and silkscreen printing are different terms for what is 
basically the same technique. Screen printing is a printing technique 
that uses a mesh to transfer ink onto a substrate. The shape is made by 
a blocking stencil. The "silk" in silkscreen refers to the material of the mesh.
However, polyester mesh has become more common in recent times.

### 09.24.16    
"Bowed guitar" is a method where you use a bow to play guitar. It sounds pretty
noisy from my one live experience with it (Sigur Rós). The method is typically
associated with Jimmy Page and Sigur Rós. As a bonus, Sigur Rós is named after
Jónsi's (lead singer) sister, Sigurrós Elín.

### 09.23.16    
Taken from the footnotes of War and Peace cause I'm lazy right now: 

> The Cossacks were free peasants living in southern Russia, renowned for 
their wild behaviour. The countess is virtually (and affectionately) calling 
her a little savage.

### 09.22.16    
According to this New Yorker article, "according to a recent CNBC report, 
seventy per cent of American online-porn access occurs during the 
nine-to-five workday." I have the first "according" because I didn't 
actually check the source. That's a very high number. Makes you wonder
when you go to use the bathroom at work, makes you wonder.

### 09.21.16    
Birkenstock resoling at Orinda Shoe Service is $65, or about half the original
cost (I have the soft footbed ones). They have the actual Birkenstock sole material,
they do it really nicely, and it only took a day, so it was pretty worth. 
It's more expensive than 
[birkenstock express, not including shipping](http://www.birkenstockexpress.com/Repair/birkenstock-repair-types.cfm), 
but in the same price range.

### 09.20.16    
`ctrl-r` for reverse incremental search in terminal. In layman's term,
this command searches for previously used commands.

Two possible causes of Riso printer jams: layers with a lot of ink and 
layers with objects close to the top of the page. 

### 8.27.16
A bike roller is a contraption used for indoor biking. It's composed of three
steel "rollers", or cylinders, which are stuck between a frame to make 
something that looks like this:

|&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|

Imagine those vertical lines being sandwiched by two horizontal lines and you get the idea. Anyways, you can put your bike on this thing and ride in place; the back wheel goes on the sister cylinders and the front wheel goes on the solo cylinder. It doesn't seem extremely difficult, although keep in mind that my point of reference is a few
drunk college cyclers. The main challenge is staying straight. 

### 8.24.16
Python objects and being hashable:
> All of Python’s immutable built-in objects are hashable, while no 
mutable containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are. Objects which are 
instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default; they all 
compare unequal (except with themselves), and their hash value is derived 
from their id().

### 8.19.16
    reflect("java.util.UUID", "randomUUID")

to generate unique ids in hive.

### 8.18.16
    wc -l < filename.txt

to get number of lines of `filename.txt`.

### 8.17.16
In Python

    a = b,

makes `a` a tuple, and makes me waste two hours of my life.

### 8.14.16
The Olympics have an interesting false start policy. It makes sense that "actual"
false starts get disqualified - that is, starts that occur before the gun. However,
Olympics people also do calculations to ensure that no one is gaming the gun; that 
is, they make sure that each person's reaction time is in the realm of possibility,
and that no one is *anticipating* the gun (and timing it just right so that 
they start after it goes but "triggered" themselves beforehand).

### 8.13.16
The world record time for the 10,000m run (men) is 26:17.53 minutes. This 
amounts to running 6.213712 miles in 26:17.53 minutes, which amounts to 
running more than 6 miles at a pace of ~4:13 minutes per mile, which amounts 
to someone being really ridiculously fast. In other news, Mo Farah won the 
10k at the Olympics again today.

### 8.10.16
Figs and wasps have a [co-dependent relationship](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/love-the-fig).
A wasp mother will bury into 
a fig and lay its eggs. However, due to the fig's booby-trapped entranced,
the mother's wings get trapped, it cannot escape, and it dies in the fig.
This results in some interesting sentences in the [Defect Levels Handbook](
http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/sanitationtransportation/ucm056174.htm):

> **Fig Paste**: Contains 13 or more insect heads per 100 grams of fig paste in each of 2 or more subsamples  
**Figs**: Average of 10% or more by count are insect-infested and/or moldy and/or dirty fruit or pieces of fruit 

### 7.18.16
`cmd-e` to split clips in Ableton Live. 

### 07.17.16
There's this music game series called Pop'n Music. The many iterations  
can be played on various consoles and in arcades. The characters are quite 
aesthetic, and there are **a lot** to choose from. In pop'n music 14 FEVER!,
there's a song called [FEVER HERO ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8A_s_PBmJA).
It's probably available in other versions too, but the point is, the song is 
flat out amazing. You can wildly mash buttons to this song at the Gameworks 
in downtown Seattle, amongst other locations around the world of which I am 
unaware.

### 06.21.16
*La petite mort*, literally translated as "the little death," is an expression
originally associated with the meaning of "fainting fit." Over time, it has 
taken on a sexual meaning, referring to "the brief loss or weakening of consciousness"
post orgasm. Basically, it's a way of describing the transcendent or melancholy
state one may feel after sex.

### 06.15.16
PHP is server side.

### 06.07.16
In artic wolf packs, alpha males and females have a shared distinct feature
of raising one hind leg when they urinate. This "raised-leg urination" bonds

Traditionally, haikus contain:

* Some aspect of "cutting" (juxtaposition of two ideas).

* 17 on. An on is kinda like the Japanese version of a syllable, but 
a bit different. For example, haibun contains 4 on: the elongated vowel gets
two and the "n" at the end of a syllable gets another. 

* Some involvement of nature.

Typically, Americans butcher all or most of these properties. I guess we've 
adopted our own kind of haiku, where we talk about random crap and our lives
and stuff (you're also not supposed to use "I" in haikus, but that's also
gone out the window).

John Cage's Roaratorio. An amalgamation of sounds and voice. More specifically,:  

* Take every sound/location from Finnegan's Wake.  

* Record every sound at its noted location. 
 
* Lay the sounds out in sequence.  

* Read passages of the book over them (some type of acrostic, still unclear
about this).

I present to you mindblowing anecdotes about twins. 
>One pair of twins both suffered crippling migraines, owned dogs that they had named Toy, married women named Linda, and had sons named James Allan (although one spelled the middle name with a single “l”). Another pair—one brought up Jewish, in Trinidad, and the other Catholic, in Nazi Germany, where he joined the Hitler Youth—wore blue shirts with epaulets and four pockets, and shared peculiar obsessive behaviors, such as flushing the toilet before using it. Both had invented fake sneezes to diffuse tense moments. Two sisters—separated long before the development of language—had invented the same word to describe the way they scrunched up their noses: “squidging.” Another pair confessed that they had been haunted by nightmares of being suffocated by various metallic objects—doorknobs, fishhooks, and the like.

Anne Sexton was a confessional poet, a bit like Sylvia Plath both as a 
person (perhaps a generalization, but note that they bonded over their shared
madness) and as a poet. Similarly to Plath, Anne battled depression and committed 
suicide at an early age. There was a part of her that always wanted more: more 
awards and accolades and affirmation. For a short period of her life, she 
performed in her very own band called Anne Sexton & Her Kind. They experimented
with a variety of musical styles - bebop and jazz and country and folk - with
Anne Sexton providing the vocals. None of the songs are sung. Instead, they're 
rhythmically read, in a way that differs from what one would expect from a 
typical poetry reading. If you do want to hear Anne sing, her voice is 
barely audible in the chorus of this [old live recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_gCY1qhUoE).

But to avoid making this a dictionary, here's something else that might be of 
slight interest. Devil tumors are *transmissible* tumors. They were first observed 
on Tasmanian devils - researchers noticed tumors on these suffering creatures 
were genetically identical, and realized that the cancer was jumping from one 
devil to another. In simple terms, these animals transmitted the cancer by biting 
each other on the face (a fairly regular behavior for them), an area which could 
contain cancerous tumors. As Tasmanian devils tend to inbreed, leading to 
relatively low genetic diversity, the tumors spread via this mechanism (as 
opposed to being killed when transferred to a foreign host).

against the Charlotte Hornets, the team for which Dell Curry played. That game

end to win the game. Those free throws were sunk by none other than Dell Curry.
In other words, Dell Curry gave Steph the chance to set this record!

FILD, which stands for Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming, is a technique that utilizes
finger movement in an attempt to induce lucid dreams. The overall idea is 
as follows. Go to sleep. Wake up ~6hrs later (should probably be in the 
middle of REM?). As you're going back to sleep, which should be very easy,
perform an up-down motion with the index and middle fingers of one hand. That
is, alternatively press the index finger down (with the middle finger up), and 
then the middle finger down (lifting the index finger up), mimicking the motion
used to repeatedly play two notes on a piano. Do this motion lightly, and focus
on it while going to sleep. The author of the thread says to perform a reality
check ~20 seconds after starting the finger movements; specifically, to pinch
the nose and try breathing in. I haven't yet tried this for fear of suffocating
but perhaps it is effective.

### 03.31.16
Copying large portions of these words from my friend Katherine because
I am lazy, ...
There are two major ways of looking at the meaning of words. The first 
is the referentialist method, and the second is the internalist. According 
to referentialists, words directly reference real objects. For 
example, if someone is talking about a desk, a referentialist would say 
they are "referencing" an actual desk in real life. On the other hand, 
according to internalists, words refer to internal concepts. With this
interpretation, the concept of a desk may vary between different people.

Referentialists run into a problem when talking about fantastical characters
like Santa Claus. The sentence "Santa Claus treats his reindeers rather 
poorly" makes sense, but from a referentialist standpoint, Santa Claus
should be referring to an actual, existing thing. In order to fix this
problem, referentialists say that Santa Claus does exist, but as an
abstract object (as opposed to a concrete one).

And so on...

In C, a static variable inside a function is locally scoped, but is changed on 
a "global" level. For example, say we have the function

    void foo(void) {
        static int x = 0;
        x++;
        printf("x = %d\n", x);
    }
    
    int main(void) {
        foo(); // prints 'x = 1'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 2'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 3'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 4'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 5'        
    }

This is neat. Note that static variables aren't stored on the stack or heap, 
but instead are kept somewhere on the data segment or BSS segment (depending 
whether the data is initialized).
