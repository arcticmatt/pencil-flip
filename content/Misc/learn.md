Summary: Making the bold assumption I learn something everyday

These short daily posts are fun. They provide, in a simple way, a timeline 
of my everyday life, through all its ups and downs and dull mundanities. 

### 01.31.16
I was informed about "the most infamous rhyme" in Middle English, which
appears in Chaucer's *The Canterbury Tales*.
>As clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queynte;  
>And prively he caughte hire by the queynte,

This chivalrous tidbit was told to me by my friend Sid, courtesy of 
Jennifer Jahner (a professor at Caltech).

### 01.30.16
My friend Sihui sent me a picture of congee, which is rice porridge.
I'd only known it as jook before. Turns out congee is the more general
term for the dish.
