Summary: Making the bold assumption I learn something everyday

These short daily posts are fun. They provide, in a simple way, a timeline 
of my everyday life, through all its ups and downs and dull mundanities. 

### 02.04.16
>All good things must come to an end.

The origin of this optimism? *Troilus and Criseyde*, a rollicking romance set 
during the Siege of Troy. I Wikipedia'd the story today for no particular reason 
(I read it last term for En121). Also, Criseyde is prounounced Chris-Aye-Duh. Or 
at least that's the way it sounds nice to my ears.

### 02.03.16
Whilst writing a political science paper for some fun school stuff, I happened
across the following lines:
>At the discretion of the commander, soldiers were authorized one pint per day 
[of beer] in garrison, and two pints per day in the field. Fresh ingredients in 
the beer were thought to offset the likelihood of scurvy.

Images of melted-down Ben & Jerry's pints (with alcohol replacing swirled dairy) 
come to mind. This stuff was found in *Redcoat Resupply!* by Major Tokar.

### 02.02.16
I (re)learned about a famous study that found guys are more likely to call an
attractive woman if they're scared of dying (fatal attraction?). They called 
it "Some Evidence for Heightened Sexual Attraction Under Conditions of High 
Anxiety." I read about it in Aziz's book. I also found out you can set 
conditional breakpoints in GDB; kinda wish I had known that a bit earlier.

### 02.01.16
After a few mishearings (Pareto? frontal? prandial?), my friend Bogdan 
(with his Romanian accent) conveyed to me the existence of the Prandtl number. 
It's not very exciting.

### 01.31.16
I was informed about "the most infamous rhyme" in Middle English, which
appears in Chaucer's *The Canterbury Tales*.
>As clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queynte;  
>And prively he caughte hire by the queynte,

My friend Sid, courtesy of Jennifer Jahner (a Caltech prof), told me this
chivalrous tidbit. 

### 01.30.16
My friend Sihui sent me a picture of congee, which is rice porridge.
I'd only known it as jook before. Turns out congee is the more general
term for the dish.
