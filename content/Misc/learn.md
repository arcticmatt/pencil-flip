Summary: Making the bold assumption I learn something everyday

These short daily posts are fun. They provide, in a simple way, a timeline 
of my everyday life, through all its ups and downs and dull mundanities. 

### 05.25.16  
12 + 1 = 11 + 2

twelve plus one & eleven plus two are anagrams

### 05.23.16  
Traditionally, haikus contain:

* Some aspect of "cutting" (juxtaposition of two ideas).

* 17 on. An on is kinda like the Japanese version of a syllable, but 
a bit different. For example, haibun contains 4 on: the elongated vowel gets
two and the "n" at the end of a syllable gets another. 

* Some involvement of nature.

Typically, Americans butcher all or most of these properties. I guess we've 
adopted our own kind of haiku, where we talk about random crap and our lives
and stuff (you're also not supposed to use "I" in haikus, but that's also
gone out the window).

### 05.18.16  
An exotic option has pricing features more complicated than typical
vanilla options (e.g. European options, American options). For example,
Asian options are *exotic*. Ooh.

### 05.17.16  
John Cage's Roaratorio. An amalgamation of sounds and voice. More specifically,:  

* Take every sound/location from Finnegan's Wake.  

* Record every sound at its noted location. 
 
* Lay the sounds out in sequence.  

* Read passages of the book over them (some type of acrostic, still unclear
about this).

Brought to my attention by Ciaran Carson.


### 05.16.16  
Symbolism is a literary movement/current, as well as that thing in books where
something stands for something else (that light in Gatsby). There are also 
a lot of other literary movements.

### 05.14.16  
copywriter : n : a person who writes the text of advertisements or publicity 
material.

Lil Dicky was a copywriter before becoming a professional rapper.

### 05.13.16  
I present to you mindblowing anecdotes about twins. 
>One pair of twins both suffered crippling migraines, owned dogs that they had named Toy, married women named Linda, and had sons named James Allan (although one spelled the middle name with a single “l”). Another pair—one brought up Jewish, in Trinidad, and the other Catholic, in Nazi Germany, where he joined the Hitler Youth—wore blue shirts with epaulets and four pockets, and shared peculiar obsessive behaviors, such as flushing the toilet before using it. Both had invented fake sneezes to diffuse tense moments. Two sisters—separated long before the development of language—had invented the same word to describe the way they scrunched up their noses: “squidging.” Another pair confessed that they had been haunted by nightmares of being suffocated by various metallic objects—doorknobs, fishhooks, and the like.

### 05.12.16  
When you die your muscles spontaneously relax and you pee and poop. 
>I did not think of my body at needle point.  
>Even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone.  
>Suicides have already betrayed the body.

\- Anne Sexton, "Wanting to Die".

### 05.10.16  
Steph Curry is the NBA's first unanimous league MVP. Go dubs.

### 05.07.16  
Reddit used to be called snew.com ("what's new?"). The changed the name 
to reddit.com because (for some reason) they couldn't keep that name. Reddit's 
logo, the alien, is named Snoo, a designation of symbolic rememberance.

### 05.06.16  
>If they survive the summer melt they are referred to as firn, German ‘of last year’. Firn are the building blocks of glaciers...

### 05.05.16  
>senescence - noun. - the condition or process of deterioration with age.

### 05.04.16  
Sylvia Plath's family nickname (she signed her letters home with it) was 
Sivvy.

### 05.02.16  
Sylvia Plath sounds like an 80 year old english lady. It's a bit scary. 
Most dreams happen in REM sleep. Ice cream places in Pasadena close at 10pm.

### 05.01.16  
Anne Sexton was a confessional poet, a bit like Sylvia Plath both as a 
person (perhaps a generalization, but note that they bonded over their shared
madness) and as a poet. Similarly to Plath, Anne battled depression and committed 
suicide at an early age. There was a part of her that always wanted more: more 
awards and accolades and affirmation. For a short period of her life, she 
performed in her very own band called Anne Sexton & Her Kind. They experimented
with a variety of musical styles - bebop and jazz and country and folk - with
Anne Sexton providing the vocals. None of the songs are sung. Instead, they're 
rhythmically read, in a way that differs from what one would expect from a 
typical poetry reading. If you do want to hear Anne sing, her voice is 
barely audible in the chorus of this [old live recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_gCY1qhUoE). 
Check out this [great piece](http://harpers.org/blog/2014/10/a-band-of-her-own/) for more info on Anne's band.

### 04.30.16  
The stable marriage problem is interesting. It should only take `O(n^2)` time 
for everyone to get engaged. I can always fall back on the scaling factor as 
an excuse. 

### 04.27.16  
I had previously thought Grimes studied neuroscience in McGill before dropping 
out. It appears that she was actually in an Electroacoustics program, where 
she studied how the brain interacts with music. In her words, this gave 
her a "basic understanding of engineering." Here's the 
[source](http://www.npr.org/2016/04/27/455769676/feeling-this-a-conversation-with-grimes).

### 04.26.16  
To overexpress a gene (have more of the corresponding protein be made), we 
can put in plasmids with a bunch of that gene (and its promoter), or 
modify the promoter to make it "stronger."

### 04.24.16  
`history` to see list of past bash commands, `!x` to execute command past 
command `x`. 

### 04.23.16  
Ska stum: mute down, unmute up. Let's word that differently (better? maybe): 
mute the downstroke, play the upstroke.

### 04.20.16  
The origin of nuclear transfer... cloning... Briggs and King... sleep.

### 04.19.16  
"Brutalist" is a type of architecture. That is, Brutalist architecture 
is characterized by its "ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable
or easy" (Wikipedia).

### 04.18.16  
To pasteurize something (milk, cheese, some other food) is simply to expose 
said something to high temperatures for enough time to kill harmful microorganisms
without destroying the quality/taste of the something.

### 04.17.16  
Two-for-one. [First](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-squirrels.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fletter-of-recommendation&action=click&contentCollection=magazine&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection): 
a collective of squirrels is a *scurry*. [Second](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-segmented-sleep.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fletter-of-recommendation&action=click&contentCollection=magazine&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=3&pgtype=collection):
in the days when segmented sleep was common (sleep, wake up and do stuff, sleep 
again) the in-between period of wakefulness was called *dorveille* by the
French. This roughly translates to "wakesleep". The English called this patch
of time "the watch."

### 04.16.16  
Today is Record Store Day (RSD), a day where record stores stock exclusive
releases (chavurches remixes on vinyl, for example) and possibly have 
live performances and/or signings.

### 04.14.16  
There's this really cool word,
>velleity
>
> a wish or inclination not strong enough to lead to action.
    
But to avoid making this a dictionary, here's something else that might be of 
slight interest. Devil tumors are *transmissible* tumors. They were first observed 
on Tasmanian devils - researchers noticed tumors on these suffering creatures 
were genetically identical, and realized that the cancer was jumping from one 
devil to another. In simple terms, these animals transmitted the cancer by biting 
each other on the face (a fairly regular behavior for them), an area which could 
contain cancerous tumors. As Tasmanian devils tend to inbreed, leading to 
relatively low genetic diversity, the tumors spread via this mechanism (as 
opposed to being killed when transferred to a foreign host).

### 04.13.16  
Heard this from Jim Barnett while watching the Warriors win their 73rd regular 
season game today. One of the Bull's 10 losses in their 72 win season came
against the Charlotte Hornets, the team for which Dell Curry played. That game
came down to the wire - specifically, Charlotte hit 2 free throws at the very
end to win the game. Those free throws were sunk by none other than Dell Curry.
In other words, Dell Curry gave Steph the chance to set this record!

### 04.12.16  
Another lazy day, another definition. 
>ampipathic - adj. - hydrophilic + hydrophobic (molecule)

My professor's first stab at pronouncing this: ampifapic.

### 04.11.16  
>cutaneous - adj. - of, relating to, or affecting the skin.

### 04.10.16  
Pandan cake is a spongy green cake. It's spongy in texture (also kinda moist
and chewy, it's nice) and also kinda looks like a green sponge. It's of Indonesian
and Malaysian origins, and is flavoured with the juice of Pandanus amaryllifolius 
leaves.

### 04.09.16  
There's this drink called *bai*. It's 5 calories, got antioxidants, and 
tastes pretty good. It's sweetened with stevia, which has some
interesting history behind it (banned at one point for being carcinogenic, used
as a sweetener by the Incan civilization, etc). I recommend the mango. 
The carbonated ones aren't as good.

### 04.06.16  
I'm tired and it's late, so let's just copy & paste some cool stuff that I found
today.

> An aphorism (from Greek ἀφορισμός aphorismos, "delimitation") is a terse saying, 
> expressing a general truth, principle, or astute observation, and spoken or 
> written in a laconic and memorable form

and...
>The Cornell box is a test aimed at determining the accuracy of rendering software 
> by comparing the rendered scene with an actual photograph of the same scene, 
> and has become a commonly used 3D test model.

For more information, I refer you to Google.

### 04.05.16  
According to Alfred Hershey (of the Hershey-Chase experiments) heaven is:
"To find one really good experiment and keep doing it over and over."

### 04.04.16  
Concert tickets have the open-door time; the venue's Twitter has the set times
(usually). 

### 04.03.16  
LP = long playing, EP = extended play (extended relative to a single).

### 04.02.16  
Philip K. Dick thinks we're all [living in 50 A.D.](https://overdoneit.wordpress.com/2013/10/10/philip-k-dick-living-in-50-a-d/).

### 04.01.16  
FILD, which stands for Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming, is a technique that utilizes
finger movement in an attempt to induce lucid dreams. The overall idea is 
as follows. Go to sleep. Wake up ~6hrs later (should probably be in the 
middle of REM?). As you're going back to sleep, which should be very easy,
perform an up-down motion with the index and middle fingers of one hand. That
is, alternatively press the index finger down (with the middle finger up), and 
then the middle finger down (lifting the index finger up), mimicking the motion
used to repeatedly play two notes on a piano. Do this motion lightly, and focus
on it while going to sleep. The author of the thread says to perform a reality
check ~20 seconds after starting the finger movements; specifically, to pinch
the nose and try breathing in. I haven't yet tried this for fear of suffocating
but perhaps it is effective.

### 03.31.16
Copying large portions of these words from my friend Katherine because
I am lazy, ...
There are two major ways of looking at the meaning of words. The first 
is the referentialist method, and the second is the internalist. According 
to referentialists, words directly reference real objects. For 
example, if someone is talking about a desk, a referentialist would say 
they are "referencing" an actual desk in real life. On the other hand, 
according to internalists, words refer to internal concepts. With this
interpretation, the concept of a desk may vary between different people.

Referentialists run into a problem when talking about fantastical characters
like Santa Claus. The sentence "Santa Claus treats his reindeers rather 
poorly" makes sense, but from a referentialist standpoint, Santa Claus
should be referring to an actual, existing thing. In order to fix this
problem, referentialists say that Santa Claus does exist, but as an
abstract object (as opposed to a concrete one).

And so on...

### 03.30.16
The max number of photos a single Facebook album can contain is 1000. Still
quite nice that, in general, Facebook can endlessly consume any amount of photos 
you throw at it.

### 03.29.16
The etymology of "poem" traces back to the Greek word "poema" which can
be literally translated as "thing made or created".

### 03.28.16
Facebook uses Haskell for spam filtering, according to Mr. Mike Vanier.

### 03.27.16
In-N-Out closes on Easter Sunday. At least, the Kettleman one does.

### 03.26.16
Freud wrote a bunch of stuff about dreams (see *The Interpretation of Dreams*,
*On Dreams*). This work was focused towards helping his patients. That is,
his goal was to use dream analysis to uncover repressed thoughts in his patients,
which he supposed would help them out (emotionally, I guess). Although some
people view his work through a philsophical lens, to him the matter was mainly
clinical.

### 03.25.16
DFW mentions (in a short story) that the average American household watches
6 hours of television a day. Not sure where he got that stat, but the current
per-person number seems to be closer to 2 hours and 50 minutes. See
[http://www.wsj.com/articles/were-working-more-hoursand-watching-more-tv-1435187603](http://www.wsj.com/articles/were-working-more-hoursand-watching-more-tv-1435187603)
for more info.

### 03.24.16
Merino is a type of sheep that was probably first bred in North Africa, and
whose wool is nice and soft. Hence, "merino wool."

### 03.23.16
The speedometers in cars have km/h as well as mph. Useful to avoid constantly
multiplying numbers by .62. I feel like this is something I have known, but not 
consciously.

### 03.22.16
Turkish deligh is "a family of confections baesd on a gel of starch and sugar."
The most legit flavor is rose, which I have never tried. Usually you see more
fruity flavors (e.g. mango, strawberry, etc.) but people also make more 
savory/non-fruity flavors, such as chocolate, almond, or coffee.

### 03.21.16
The Space Needle is 605 feet, or about 185 meters. Creepy game: pick a person
and follow them (with your eyes) for as long as you can. Weird observation: 
someone might be watching you at this very moment...

### 03.20.16
Portlanders sometimes refer to Portland (usually in text) as pdx. This abbreviation
also refers to Portland's airport. It's analagous to calling Los Angeles lax, or 
San Francisco sfo. I saw this used in various books, zines, and bumper stickers,
and confirmed its usage with my airbnb host, Heidi.

### 03.19.16
According to the "Zinester's Guide to Portland (5th Ed.)" and Wikipedia, 
Powell's City of Books is the largest independent bookstore in the world.
They sure do have a lot of Sylvia Plath books.

### 03.18.16
The FDA "alcohol line" stands at 0.5%. That is, any beverage whose alcoholic
contents exceed that percentage are marked as booze.

### 03.16.16
Amsterdam is known for its tulips, amongst other things.

### 03.14.16
Steph Curry's birthday is Pi day. Steph Curry's birthday is today. Today is
Pi day. Sadly, I ate no pie.

### 03.13.16
Was busy spending quality time with Pintos today so I kind of cheated and just
found this while browsing the front page of Reddit: 
[There are more doughnut shops per capita in Canada than anywhere else on the planet](http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-doughnut-unofficial-national-sugary-snack).

### 03.12.16
The income tax was first thought of in 1812 (war with England), adopted in 
1861 (Civil War), adopted again in 1894 (Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act), and finalized
with the 16th amendment.

### 03.11.16
"Google recommends LuminPDF as its third-party provider for seamless PDF editing."
Basically, you can open PDFs stored in Google Drive in the LuminPDF app, and then
mark them up (highlight, underline, strikethrough, insert text, etc.). I couldn't
actually figure out how to save the edited PDF back to drive, but I'm sure it's
possible.

### 03.10.16
In C, a static variable inside a function is locally scoped, but is changed on 
a "global" level. For example, say we have the function

    void foo(void) {
        static int x = 0;
        x++;
        printf("x = %d\n", x);
    }
    
    int main(void) {
        foo(); // prints 'x = 1'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 2'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 3'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 4'
        foo(); // prints 'x = 5'        
    }

This is neat. Note that static variables aren't stored on the stack or heap, 
but instead are kept somewhere on the data segment or BSS segment (depending 
whether the data is initialized).

### 03.09.16
AlphaGo (AI developed by Google's DeepMind team) beat the legendary Go player
Lee Se-dol, a seemingly big step forward for the field. Compare this to 
Facebook's [darkforest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkforest)...

### 03.08.16
The hard problem of consciousness can be phrased in the following way: "why do
qualia exist?" In other words, what accounts for the unique sensation of color
that people experience upon viewing the same night sky? This problem stands
in contrast to easy problems, which can be explained via mechanisms.

### 03.07.16
The supremum is the least upper bound. Maybe if I type this down I'll actually
remember it.

### 03.06.16
A zine containing Wikipedia lists (and lists of lists, and lists of lists
of lists, etc.) informed me of Sweden's Donald Duck Party - a joke party that
has been receiving joke/protests votes for years. At its peak, it was the 
9th most popular party.

### 03.02.16
Boba was invented in Taiwan. I feel like I might have known this already?

### 03.01.16
The psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott invented the concepts of "True Self"
and "False Self". "True Self" is the sense of self that comes from
"authentic experience", and a feeling of being alive. "False Self" is a facade -
the sense of self that arises when one, perhaps, is not completely comfortable 
and puts on an overthought front. 

### 02.29.16
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas managed to go ten years without speaking
during "oral arguments." He broke the streak by asking a question. This led
to the fantastic headline, **Justice Clarence Thomas breaks 10-year streak, 
asks question in court**.

### 02.28.16
Otto Plath was a really interesting guy. He "detested stock responses", 
and used to skin, cook, and eat a rat during his college classes. The so-called
"Bee-King", he used to follow bees to their nesting place and suck the honey
from the hive with a long straw. He had a seemingly mystical power over
bees; they never stung him when he caught them, and he once caught a bee in his fist
and held it to his young daughter's ear.

### 02.26.16
Kafka never finished *The Castle*.

### 02.25.16
Did you know that nose whistles exist?

### 02.24.16
"I Wandered Lonley as a Cloud" is a happy poem by William Woodsworth (thanks
Katherine).

### 02.23.16
The [McDonald's theory of war](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/06/russia.mcdonalds),
which isn't actually true, posits that countries with McDonald's don't go to
war with each other.

### 02.22.16
HeLa is immortal! It also came about from a bunch of random factors (not all
cancer cells grow in culture). Bioethics is interesting.

### 02.21.16
My old math prof, Matilde Marcolli, does art. I didn't see it, but my roommmate
described it as "watercolor over math notes" - he saw her work on display at
Century books. I heard there are some matrix rotations in there. 

### 02.20.16
People in Romania say "house of stone" when people get married. Roughly,
it means "good luck and strong marriage." 

### 02.19.16
Emily Dickinson wrote about 1500 poems. Of these, around 10 were published
during her lifetime.

### 02.18.16
My CS144 set had a variant of the [pirate game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_game)
on it, which is a cool game-theory type brain teaser. 

### 02.17.16
A study was done that found drunk people are more likely to push the
fat man (or route the trolley).

### 02.16.16
Ben & Jerry's is 5-10 times more expensive as some other ice creams (Lucerne, 
Dreyer's, those other cheap ones). Per-X prices are handy.

### 02.15.16
After iterating through three Keegan facts, here's what popped out:
Kanye West and Kanye North are 
[parliamentary constituents of Botswana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_constituencies_of_Botswana).

### 02.14.16
Pointer arithmetic on a `void *` is illegal in C and C++, but GCC allows it 
(increments/decrements happen in byte size chunks). 

### 02.13.16
Apparently, you can bike from Manhattan Beach to Manhattan Beach in about a month.

### 02.12.16
There's a synthesizer called Synplant where you plant seeds that grow into
synth patches; kind of like an organic, less numerical approach to sound. Found out
about it in this [Grimes interview](http://imgur.com/gallery/S9esf/).

### 02.11.16
I feel like it would be better if the information intake in my life were a little
more evenly distributed. It turns out that gravitational waves exist. Thanks
LIGO & Caltech & smart people. Also, 99% of all households purchase milk (source:
my friend Matt: source: random milk facts website).

### 02.10.16
Adolf Eichmann dabbled massively in the logistics of killing Jews. Another one
from *Kafka*.

### 02.09.16
A bildungsroman is "a novel dealing with one person's formative years or spiritual 
education." I came across this term in *Kafka on the Shore*, a book (quite good
and weird so far) which uses it fairly frequently.

### 02.08.16
The Linux kernel switches schedulers a lot. The default scheduler right now
is the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). There's also a scheduler, created 
as an alternative to the CFS, called the Brain F Scheduler (BFS). I feel like
profane names prophecy the inevitable non-mainstreamity of the namee, although
I guess the name could always be changed.

### 02.07.16
Indigo children supposedly possess special powers like talking to dead people and/or
God. They're named after the blue aura which supposedly surrounds them. I suppose
they could supposedly exist.

### 02.06.16
You can use Pyenv to switch between Python versions!

### 02.05.16
Victor, one of my housemates, got sick today. It might be norovirus, which 
is apparently highly contagious and can be transferred by eating someone's 
stool. 

### 02.04.16
>All good things must come to an end.

The origin of this optimism? *Troilus and Criseyde*, a rollicking romance set 
during the Siege of Troy. I Wikipedia'd the story today for no particular reason 
(I read it last term for En121). Also, Criseyde is prounounced Chris-Aye-Duh. Or 
at least that's the way it sounds nice to my ears.

### 02.03.16
Whilst writing a political science paper for some fun school stuff, I happened
across the following lines:
>At the discretion of the commander, soldiers were authorized one pint per day 
[of beer] in garrison, and two pints per day in the field. Fresh ingredients in 
the beer were thought to offset the likelihood of scurvy.

Images of melted-down Ben & Jerry's pints (with alcohol replacing swirled dairy) 
come to mind. This stuff was found in *Redcoat Resupply!* by Major Tokar.

### 02.02.16
I (re)learned about a famous study that found guys are more likely to call an
attractive woman if they're scared of dying (fatal attraction?). They called 
it "Some Evidence for Heightened Sexual Attraction Under Conditions of High 
Anxiety." I read about it in Aziz's book. I also found out you can set 
conditional breakpoints in GDB; kinda wish I had known that a bit earlier.

### 02.01.16
After a few mishearings (Pareto? frontal? prandial?), my friend Bogdan 
(with his Romanian accent) conveyed to me the existence of the Prandtl number. 
It's not very exciting.

### 01.31.16
I was informed about "the most infamous rhyme" in Middle English, which
appears in Chaucer's *The Canterbury Tales*.
>As clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queynte;  
>And prively he caughte hire by the queynte,

My friend Sid, courtesy of Jennifer Jahner (a Caltech prof), told me this
chivalrous tidbit. 

### 01.30.16
My friend Sihui sent me a picture of congee, which is rice porridge.
I'd only known it as jook before. Turns out congee is the more general
term for the dish.
