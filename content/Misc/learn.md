Summary: Making the bold assumption I learn something everyday

These short daily posts are fun. They provide, in a simple way, a timeline 
of my everyday life, through all its ups and downs and dull mundanities. 

### 02.20.16
People in Romania say "house of stone" when people get married. Roughly,
it means "good luck and strong marriage." 

### 02.19.16
Emily Dickinson wrote about 1500 poems. Of these, around 10 were published
during her lifetime.

### 02.18.16
My CS144 set had a variant of the [pirate game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_game)
on it, which is a cool game-theory type brain teaser. 

### 02.17.16
A study was done that found drunk people are more likely to push the
fat man (or route the trolley).

### 02.16.16
Ben & Jerry's is 5-10 times more expensive as some other ice creams (Lucerne, 
Dreyer's, those other cheap ones). Per-X prices are handy.

### 02.15.16
After iterating through three Keegan facts, here's what popped out:
Kanye West and Kanye North are 
[parliamentary constituents of Botswana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_constituencies_of_Botswana).

### 02.14.16
Pointer arithmetic on a `void *` is illegal in C and C++, but GCC allows it 
(increments/decrements happen in byte size chunks). 

### 02.13.16
Apparently, you can bike from Manhattan Beach to Manhattan Beach in about a month.

### 02.12.16
There's a synthesizer called Synplant where you plant seeds that grow into
synth patches; kind of like an organic, less numerical approach to sound. Found out
about it in this [Grimes interview](http://imgur.com/gallery/S9esf/).

### 02.11.16
I feel like it would be better if the information intake in my life were a little
more evenly distributed. It turns out that gravitational waves exist. Thanks
LIGO & Caltech & smart people. Also, 99% of all households purchase milk (source:
my friend Matt: source: random milk facts website).

### 02.10.16
Adolf Eichmann dabbled massively in the logistics of killing Jews. Another one
from *Kafka*.

### 02.09.16
A bildungsroman is "a novel dealing with one person's formative years or spiritual 
education." I came across this term in *Kafka on the Shore*, a book (quite good
and weird so far) which uses it fairly frequently.

### 02.08.16
The Linux kernel switches schedulers a lot. The default scheduler right now
is the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). There's also a scheduler, created 
as an alternative to the CFS, called the Brain F Scheduler (BFS). I feel like
profane names prophecy the inevitable non-mainstreamity of the namee, although
I guess the name could always be changed.

### 02.07.16
Indigo children supposedly possess special powers like talking to dead people and/or
God. They're named after the blue aura which supposedly surrounds them. I suppose
they could supposedly exist.

### 02.06.16
You can use Pyenv to switch between Python versions!

### 02.05.16
Victor, one of my housemates, got sick today. It might be norovirus, which 
is apparently highly contagious and can be transferred by eating someone's 
stool. 

### 02.04.16
>All good things must come to an end.

The origin of this optimism? *Troilus and Criseyde*, a rollicking romance set 
during the Siege of Troy. I Wikipedia'd the story today for no particular reason 
(I read it last term for En121). Also, Criseyde is prounounced Chris-Aye-Duh. Or 
at least that's the way it sounds nice to my ears.

### 02.03.16
Whilst writing a political science paper for some fun school stuff, I happened
across the following lines:
>At the discretion of the commander, soldiers were authorized one pint per day 
[of beer] in garrison, and two pints per day in the field. Fresh ingredients in 
the beer were thought to offset the likelihood of scurvy.

Images of melted-down Ben & Jerry's pints (with alcohol replacing swirled dairy) 
come to mind. This stuff was found in *Redcoat Resupply!* by Major Tokar.

### 02.02.16
I (re)learned about a famous study that found guys are more likely to call an
attractive woman if they're scared of dying (fatal attraction?). They called 
it "Some Evidence for Heightened Sexual Attraction Under Conditions of High 
Anxiety." I read about it in Aziz's book. I also found out you can set 
conditional breakpoints in GDB; kinda wish I had known that a bit earlier.

### 02.01.16
After a few mishearings (Pareto? frontal? prandial?), my friend Bogdan 
(with his Romanian accent) conveyed to me the existence of the Prandtl number. 
It's not very exciting.

### 01.31.16
I was informed about "the most infamous rhyme" in Middle English, which
appears in Chaucer's *The Canterbury Tales*.
>As clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queynte;  
>And prively he caughte hire by the queynte,

My friend Sid, courtesy of Jennifer Jahner (a Caltech prof), told me this
chivalrous tidbit. 

### 01.30.16
My friend Sihui sent me a picture of congee, which is rice porridge.
I'd only known it as jook before. Turns out congee is the more general
term for the dish.
