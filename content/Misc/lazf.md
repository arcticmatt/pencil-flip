What's up LAZF, or anyone else reading this. Hope you're having a swell day. 
Anyways, here are some snippets from a bunch of zines my friends and I have
made over the past year or so.   
<br/>

### Finished Zines

This is Matt's "aphasia" zine. Aphasia is the "loss of ability to understand or express speech, caused by brain damage."
If you have aphasia you can probably still read it because all the words are writing. 
That made a lot of sense. Anyways, this zine has really cool-styled drawings
that accompany short stories or ideas or statements that might be about
monsters, superheroes, giving someone a mixtape, play-doh; I'll stop describing
now, the pictures are a better indicator.

The theme of this one is "improv." Matt did some improv drawings, whatever that means.
I think you just kinda think of something and then draw it (no planning or sketching
or anything). Not really sure though. He also wrote some poems. I like them.
I played a bunch of easy chords on Matt's guitar, freestyled over them, and 
recorded/wrote down the output. This was the first zine we (Matt & Matt) made together.

This zine was made mainly by me. It also has some contributions from Matt, Kath,
and Victor. The theme is "summer labor." I was interning at a big tech company. Some days 
it seemed like the only conversations I had were about work. In this zine you'll
find inside jokes, poems, crappy drawings done in inkscape, and some other cool
stuff my friends did that's much higher quality than my stuff.

This is Katherine's zine! Kath uses a lot of exclamation marks. She's 
a super good designer. She's also probably the happiest person I know; accordingly, 
this zine is about all things happy.  It has drawings of cats and flowers, a 
quote from winnie the pooh, a translation of a chinese love song, and a bunch of 
other happy stuff.

### WIP Zines 
Those are all our currently finished ones. Below are snippets of some zines
we're working on right now (they're all about ~50% done, so we'll finish them 
in the next month or so).   
<br/>

A zine featuring art with pastel-y colors. It's more art-centric than our other 
zines. We plan on filling it with a bunch of digital artwork with pastel color 
schemes and rather simple, yet interesting shapes.

This one doesn't really have a theme yet. So far it's just a bunch of cool 
drawings in a variety of styles. We plan on adding text/captions to some of them.
Some of them will tell a story, some will require we tell a story for them.
