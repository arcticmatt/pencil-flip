What's up LAZF, or anyone else reading this. Hope you're having a swell day. 
Anyways, here are a bunch of zines my friends and I have made over the past year
or so. They're not the entire things, just 8 pages "previews."   
<br/>

This is Matt's "aphasia" zine. Aphasia is the "loss of ability to understand or express speech, caused by brain damage."
If you have aphasia you can probably still read it because all the words are writing. 
That made a lot of sense. Anyways, this zine has really cool-styled drawings
that accompany short stories or ideas or statements that might be about
monsters, superheroes, giving someone a mixtape, play-doh; I'll stop describing
now, the pictures are probably a better indicator.

The theme of this one is "improv." Matt did some improv drawings, whatever that means.
I think you just kinda think of something and then draw it (no planning or sketching
or anything). Not really sure though. I played a bunch of easy chords on my guitar,
freestyled over them, and recorded/wrote down the output. This was the first
zine we (Matt & Matt) made together.

This zine was made mainly by me. It also has some contributions from Matt, Kath,
and Victor. The theme is "summer labor." I was interning at a big tech company; some days 
it seemed like the only conversations I had were about work. In this zine you'll
find inside jokes, poems, crappy drawings done in inkscape, and some other cool
stuff my friends did that's probably much higher quality than my stuff.

This is Katherine's zine! Kath uses a lot of exclamation marks. She's 
a super good designer. She's also probably the happiest person I know; accordingly, 
this zine is about all things happy.  It has drawings of cats and flowers, a 
quote from winnie the pooh, a translation of a chinese love song, and a bunch of other happy stuff.
