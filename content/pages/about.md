Hey, what's up. I'm Matt. Here are some quick hitters about me.

* I'm currently a Software Engineer in Silicon Valley, winning no awards for originality.
* I went to Caltech, where I majored in CS and minored in English. Hence the "Caltech" tab at the top
of this blog. Guess I planned to write more about it... that turned out well.

So, what's this blog about? In short, it's about things I read, things I listen to,
things happening in my general vicinity: things which strike me as worth
writing about. In other words, random stuff. Have fun!
