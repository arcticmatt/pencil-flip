Hey, what's up. I'm arctictern, or Matt. Here are some quick hitters about me.

* I'm a college student at Caltech majoring in CS.
* I like basketball: playing it, watching it, reading about it,  and talking about it.
* I like music: playing it (on guitar), singing it (not very well), listening to it,
  and talking about it.
* I like reading books, articles, poems, and the back of shampoo bottles.
* More specifically, the Golden State Warriors are my favorite basketball team,
  I enjoy playing Neutral Milk Hotel and Priscilla Ahn on guitar, and Ratatouille
  is my favorite movie. And I occasionaly ponder the runtime of various algorithms.

So, what's this blog about? In short, it's about things I like, things I dislike,
and things I find particularly interesting. This means there will be some
recommendations or opinions of various books, songs, and movies. There will also
be some suggestions regarding various things to do and places at which to eat around
Pasadena, or wherever I'm currently living. Thrown in there will be some write ups
on a panoply of interesting things: maybe Hofstede's dimensions, or Dunbar's Number.
Gotta keep it intellectual somehow. Besides that, it's gonna be a grab bag. One
day there might be a post about why George Michael (of Arrested Development fame)
is America's ultimate hero; the next, it might be all about writing cover letters
for tech companies.

If any of the above suits your fancy, then you're in luck! I hope that this blog
will stave off your boredom while you're waiting for your friend to get ready, or
during your daily dump. And if not, then I recommend
[theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com). It has some interesting articles.
