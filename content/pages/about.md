Hey, what's up. I'm Matt. Here are some quick hitters about me.

* I'm a college student at Caltech majoring in CS.

So, what's this blog about? In short, it's about things I read, things I listen to,
things happening in my general vicinity: things which strike me as worth 
writing about. In other words, random stuff. Have fun!
