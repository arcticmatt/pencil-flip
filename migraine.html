                <h2>Intro &amp; Writing Style</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, if you suffer from migraines (or perhaps
are affected in a secondary manner), you should buy this book without a second
thought. If you don’t have migraines, but are interested in neurology,
hallucinations, and/or strange and bizarre clinical cases, this should also be a
great read.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few words about Oliver’s writing. For the most part
it's very understandable; he breaks down and builds up concepts in a clear
and concise manner. The book is well organized. There are five main sections,
each of which contains a few chapters, each of which is broken up into smaller
chapter sections. This organization makes it really easy to find a specific
topic, as well as to fit individual ideas into the bigger picture. That being
said, certain sections where he shotguns a storm of medical lingo are a
bit more challenging to understand. There were pages where I had to stop five or
six times to check a definition on Merriam Webster. Beware: you may need to
brush up on your high school bio. Some words you'll run into every few pages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>autonomic</li>
<li>sympathetic </li>
<li>parasympathetic</li>
<li>pathognomonic</li>
<li>vasoconstriction</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these (except for pathognomonic) should look pretty familiar. They
looked familiar to me, but I forgot what they meant. The trickiest words
are those with multiple meanings. I read around 100 pages thinking that
vegetative was being used in a “couch potato” kind of way. Turns out it can also
mean autonomic. Woops. Suffice it to say, if you’re not studying for med school,
you might need a dictionary. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alright, got the boring parts out of the way. I’m gonna
talk about the content now, which hopefully is not that boring. We’ll
start with section 3, and then work our way out concentrically to the first and last
sections. That was a joke. We’ll start with section 1.  </p>
<h2>The Experience of Migraine</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section is, as you may have guessed, about the
experience of migraine. It covers a variety of migraine types and their
symptoms. In other words, this section answers the question
<strong>"what is a migraine"</strong> from the subjective perspective of a migraineur (i.e. a
connoisseur for migraines). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recognise a migraine as being constituted by certain symptoms of
a certain duration in a certain sequence. (111-113)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This definition is somewhat vague, which is appropriate for 
the subject
at hand. Sacks says that the structure of a migraine can vary in
three ways: length, levels (i.e. which levels of the nervous system it affects), 
and symptoms. In other words, there are a million different things which
can be called a migraine. Say you have an intense unilateral headache
every time you smell blue cheese. That's a migraine. Say you have a 
bilateral headache and nauseau at 2pm on the third Thursday of every 
month. Migraine. Say you have no headache, no nauseau, but instead intense 
abdominal pain whenever you see a puppy. Also a migraine (or,
if you prefer, migraine equivalent). I've gotten a little ahead of
myself by mentioning how these migraines <em>occur</em>; this section
merely covers the symptoms. I hope these examples give 
at least a general idea of how varied a migraine can be. If not, then
this list of possible systems might help:</p>
<ul>
<li>headache</li>
<li>nauseau</li>
<li>itching or burning in the eyes</li>
<li>sensitivity to light</li>
<li>blurred vision</li>
<li>stuffy nose</li>
<li>stomach pain</li>
<li>bowel problems</li>
<li>drowsiness</li>
<li>fever</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's just a few. We've now covered the first <em>major idea</em> of 
this section: <strong>migraine is an umbrella term, and drastically varies 
from person to person</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now, I imagine you desperately desire to know the second major idea,
and the third major idea, and the fourth major idea, and so on and so on.
Unfortunately, there is only one other <em>major idea</em>. It's pretty simple too,
and here's how it goes: <strong>migraines, based on their symptoms,
can be classified into three categories: common migraine, migraine equivalent,
and classic migraine</strong>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common migraine is characterized by headache and nausea. But wait,
there's more. There are a number of symptoms which may accompany the leading duo, some of 
which are listed above. Basically, a common migraine is what springs to mind 
when someone says "I have a migraine." </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Migraine equivalents are migraines, but without the headache. That is, they have
the same form and structure as migraines, but different symptoms. One pleasant
example is periodic diarrhoea (did you know how this was spelled? it looks weird). If you get diarrhoe from the same circumstances,
or with the same periodicity as one might get migraines, it's classified as
a "migraine equivalent."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classic migraines are migraines with auras; an aura is a sensory hallucination. The name "classic" might be 
misleading. It implies that these types of migraines are uncommon and out of date,
which is a total lie. It might also hint at something old and boring. For example,
a friend might come up to you and say "yo have you read <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> by
Jane Austen, it's a classic!". I'd imagine you'd respond with something like "nah,
that book is super old and boring read something more modern like <em>Harry Potter
and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>." It turns out migraine auras are fascinating,
almost as fascinating as the adventures of the boy who lived. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chapter on classical migraines is the longest in the book, and for good reason.
This stuff is crazy. The length of the post is already getting a little out of hand,
so I'm going to keep it very short (hopefully). If it sounds interesting, buy
the book and read this one chapter (chapter 3). It'll be worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alright. We know that a classic migraine is a migraine with an aura. But  what
happens when you get <em>just</em> the aura, with no headaches or other migraine
symptoms occuring before or after? That's still a migraine. See how general this
term is? It's kinda like if we called bagels and lox the same thing. There are
many different types of bagels, and sometimes they come with lox. But you can
also eat the lox by itself. Therefore the lox is a bagel. That was a
terrible analogy and is probably logically inconsistent but whatever. 
Here are some interesting examples of migraine
auras:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>zoom vision</em>: vision zooms in and out</li>
<li><em>mosaic vision</em>: stuff starts to look pointilliste, then mosaic, then cubist (or
some subset/combination of those)</li>
<li><em>cinematographic vision</em>: stuff starts to look like a movie playing at 12fps</li>
<li><em>scintillating scotoma</em>: sparkling and jagged lines appear across the vision</li>
<li><em>negative scotoma</em>: certain parts of the visual field disappear</li>
<li><em>bagel vision</em>: a specific type of negative scotoma where people's heads look 
like bagels (i.e. a ring of flesh surrounding a void) </li>
</ul>
<p>One more thing. Migraine auras are somewhat special in that the recipient is 
completely conscious/aware during the aura. Thus, a lot of migraineurs have created cool
visualizations of their auras. You can check some of them out
<a href="https://migraine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/migraine-art-slideshow/?_r=0">here</a>.</p>
<h2>The Occurence of Migraine</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, that previous section is way too long. I just wanted to write a quick and 
dirty review of this book, and now I'm summarizing the whole thing like I'm doing 
a third grade (fifth grade?) book report. I'll try to use less words for these other sections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section is about <strong>when migraines occur</strong>. Remember how in the previous
section, we classified migraines based on their symptoms? Now we're gonna classify
them based on their occurence. This gives us the following three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>periodic and paroxysmal migraine</li>
<li>circumstantial migraine</li>
<li>situational migraine</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Periodic and <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/paroxysmal">paroxysmal</a> 
migraines are characterized by a recurring schedule. Ideally, this category
would only contain migraines that occur <em>irrespective of the mode
of life</em>. In other words, nothing in particular causes the migraines; they just happen.
For example, a woman who gets menstrual migraines every month, no matter
what she does, would have a periodic migraine. Note: it may seem like there's
some cause and effect going on here. To clarify, we can think of periodic 
migraines as being an innate aspect of an individual. Then, just as women have
periods "built-in," people can have migraines "built-in." However, periodic migraines have
a gray area. A migraine may appear to be periodic, but really be caused by a 
recurring situation. For example, if a professor works intensely hard Monday through
Friday and gets a migraine on Saturday, she would have a circumstantial migraine.
Psychological aspects might also come into play. Specifically, occurence of 
migraines could be encouraged by expectancy. In other words, if a person
expects to get a migraine according to a certain schedule, and that expectation
is somehow met a few times, that schedule might
become reality. Think Lavar Ball and speaking things into existence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumstantial migraines are migraines that arise under certain conditions. 
For example, light, noise, odours, weather, exercises, pain, and fasting can 
all cause migraines. More specifically, "looking at bright lights" could be
the circumstances in which one gets a migraine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Situational migraines are migraines that arise under certain situations. This
sounds extremely similar to circumstantial migraines; the main difference is
that situations are internal, and cirumstances external. While
circumstantial migraines depend largely on one's environment, situational 
migraines depend more on the individual's mental state. For example (case 81 in
the book), consider a 55-year-old man. He's an Auschwitz survivor. However,
his entire family died there; he's the only one who escaped. Since
then, he's been "chronically depressed, guilt-ridden, [and] preoccupied
with the deaths of all his relatives" (168), and gets 10 migraines every
month. These migraines are an emotional outlet, a way to express his guilt in
a self-harming manner. Note how emotions, and not surroundings, are the cause
of these situational migraines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus we might wonder, from the start, whether such circumstantial migraines
are best considered as <em>reactions to</em> overwhelming emotion, and situational 
migraines as <em>expressions of</em> chronic, repressed, emotional drives. (217)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Basis of Migraine</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, I'm actually gonna make this shorter. This section talks about <strong>what
causes a migraine</strong>. There are three (yet another trio!) types of causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physiological</li>
<li>Biological</li>
<li>Psychological</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physiological causes are not completely understood. The following sums
it up fairly nicely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The migraine reaction is characterised, at lower functional levels, by
protracted parasympathetic or trophotropic tonus, preceded and succeeded by
physiological opposite states. At its higher functional levels, it is
characterised by activation (and succeeding inhibition) of countless cortical
fields, from the primary sensory areas to the most complex integrative areas. Migraine
is considered as a form of centrencephalic paroxysm in slow-motion, in 
the case of the aura 20 to 200 times slower, and in the case of a common migraine
some thousands of times slower, than their epileptic counterparts. It is also
necessary to consider migraine as a complex adaptive task performed by 
a complex functional system, in which the means of performance (which are 
extremely variable) are subordinated to its ends. (203)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, migraines span many physiological levels, and are kind of like a 
slower version of epilepsy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animals have two types of protective reflexes. The first is fight-or-flight. 
The second is what I'm gonna call hide-and-cry. As examples, consider the 
chameleon, the opossum, and the skunk. These animals use camouflage, fake death,
and smelly stuff to "avert" danger. Migraine can be seen as a complex extension
of a primitive hide-and-cry reaction. As humans have grown in complexity so 
have migraines, which has led to a complex and varied mechanism. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The psychological causes of migraines are the most interesting, at least to me.
Sacks breaks them up into the following categories</p>
<ul>
<li><em>recuperative</em>: these tend to occur after a prolonged stretch of emotional and/or
physical exertion, and are typically followed by refreshed feelings of strength
and energy. One may think of recuperative migraines as a form of forced rest.</li>
<li><em>regressive</em>: "...regressive attacks are marked by pitiful suffering, dependency-needs,
and cries for help. In a word, they assume the characteristics not of sleep,
but of illness" (214).</li>
<li><em>encapsulative</em>: these migraines encapsulate painful feelings, transforming 
prolonged suffering into a relatively short migraine. For example, menstrual
migraines can condense the stresses of the month into a migraine. The summation
of pain might not change, but the duration is made much shorter.</li>
<li><em>dissociative</em>: you know that classic picture of an iceberg, where it's a lot
bigger under water? This is the migraine equivalent. Some people are divided into
two parts. One part is the public part that acts happy and well. The other is 
the private, and perhaps repressed, part, which revels in pain and suffering.
This latter part is responsible for dissociative migraines. In other words,
these migraines express some hidden or repressed emotional suffering. </li>
<li><em>aggressive</em>: these tend to happen when one harbors feelings of rage or hostility
towards someone, but it is impossible to express these feelings in a normal manner.
The migraine takes the place of a verbal or physical outlash.</li>
<li><em>emulative</em>: a sympathy migraine. That is, a migraine that emulates the 
sickness of someone else.</li>
<li><em>self-punitive</em>: mostly occuring in "deeply masochistic, spiteful, [and] chronically
depressed" people. A form of self-punishment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the particular interest of situational migraines, and their special 
strategic value to the patient, is that <em>they represent biological reactions
which can double as symptomatic acts or conversion symptoms</em>. (222)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Therapeutic Approaches to Migraine</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the last section wasn't that short. Oh well, at least it was easier to write.
It's mainly just copied content. Hopefully this section will be even easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sections covers acute (stuff you take during the attack) and preventative 
(stuff you take to prevent future attacks) treatments. The history of 
migraine treatments is as follows. In the old days (~100 years ago) we didn't really
know what caused migraines. So there were a bunch of drugs that did different things
(e.g. targeted different neurotransmitters). This led to polypharmacy, where 
patients took five or six drugs in hopes of a therapeutic combination of meds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we've discovered a bit more about how migraines work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most general hypothesis is that of Lance, who envisages the initiation
of attacks in the hypothalamus, whether on the basis of a built-in periodicity,
or in response to sensory stimuli from the cerebral cortex. Once initiated, 
impulses descend from the hypothalamus to the periaqueductal grey matter, thence
to the raphe nuclei, and here, as we have seen, they can affect the cortical
microcirculation, constricting it, initiating "spreading depression" in the 
cortex (and thus producing the aura phase of the attack), and at the same time 
reducing pain perception by closing the (enkephalinergic) "gate" in the spinal
cord. (259).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With new understanding has come new drugs, which target more specific mechanisms
than their predecessors. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As someone who has migraines (they might instead be chronic headaches, 
according to my neurologist), the drugs in this section were pretty recognizable.
Off the top of my head, Sacks covers propranolol, amitriptyline, verapamil,
and feverfew. He also covers stuff like accupuncture and biofeedback. Note that newer research shows that feverfew has adverse effects
if taken over a prolonged period. Personally, I've taken topomax, indomethacin,
propranolol, verapamil, and amitriptyline. Topomax was the only one that
really worked, but I think I got too used to the drug because the headaches came
back. These chapters show how wide the range of migraine drugs is, and how 
treatment may require large amounts of trial-and-error. I can definitely relate.</p>
<h2>Migraine as a Universal</h2>
<p>This chapter is a broad exploration on hallucination. It turns out migraine
auras share many features with other types of hallucations (e.g. ones induced
by mescal or weed). There are also some connections between chaos theory and 
migraine auras. I'm too lazy to write about it, and am also slightly unsure
of my understanding, so that's all I'll say.</p>
<h2>Finally Done</h2>
<p>I don't think anyone will actually read this far, but if you have, congratulations!
