## instructions for myself

I always forget how to update this thing. I have this alias in my `.zshrc`. 

```
alias activate_pelican='cd ~/virtualenvs/pelican && source bin/activate && cd -'
```

1. Make some changes. Remember to change the date in the headers.
2. Run `activate_pelican`
3. Commit and push changes.
