                <p>These short daily posts are fun. They provide, in a simple way, a timeline 
of my everyday life, through all its ups and downs and dull mundanities. </p>

<p>I found this out a while ago but I guess I forgot to use it. In Ableton,
if you drag an clip into a midi track which has an instrument, it will convert
the audio to midi (if no instrument is loaded, the midi track turns into an audio track
and no conversion happens). Three options are given for the conversion: harmony, melody,
and drums. Harmony supports polyphony, while melody is a monophonic conversion.
The last option tries to pick up the percussive elements of the audio; if 
the instrument loaded into the track is a drum rack, this type of conversion will
be used automatically. You can also right-click the audio clip to access
these conversions. Right-clicking also gives you the option to "Slice to New Midi Track,"
which converts slices of the audio into samples for a drum rack (these slices
can be set either automatically or with warp markers). All this info is available
in the <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/converting-audio-to-midi/">Ableton Reference Manual</a>.</p>

<p>TIL there's a diamond certification for records, which requires the sale of 
10 million copies. For comparison, platinum is 1 million for an album, and 2 million for a single.
Diamond doesn't have the album/single distinction; the 10 million applies to 
any "single title".</p>

<p>Opinion: Green Apple books is better than City Lights and Alley Cat. I think it's 
bigger (I spent ~ an hour just wandering around the fiction &amp; music annex until
I realized that the main store was an entirely different thing) and it's got more
personality (semicircular shelves are fun, cool staircases, music and records and dvds!,
lots of used books, cool intercom system directing staff around, etc.). 
Fact (according to the Google description): there are more than 60,000 new &amp; 100,000 used books 
at Green Apple books.  </p>

<p>I bought a music box in Monterey yesterday. I'm too lazy to explain how it works,
but it's very cool. They're different from gramophones if that's what you were
thinking. The woman in the store told me they were invented in 1750, but it 
appears they were actually invented in 1796 by Antoine Favre (at least
that's when the "key advancement" was made, there were similar things before).</p>

<p>So Katz's Deli is super good. Everyone knows that. But does everyone know that
kids love cinnamon toast crunch? Yes, everyone also knows that. But does everyone
know that Katz's Deli has a super modern website and <em>ships</em> their product
<strong>nationwide</strong>??? Probably not. <a href="http://www.katzsdelicatessen.com/shipping.html">Check it</a>.
You can get <em>sliced pastrami by the pound</em> shipped from NY to your doorstep.
You can get <em>matzoh ball soup</em> shipped from NY to your doorstep. What a

<p>I feel like I learned some things while driving today, but I also feel like
I forgot all those things. I bought a <em>Midori</em> brand notebook the other day
at a stationary store in Highland Park (the store was quite nice, it had cool 
marine life posters). The notebook also seems pretty nice. I haven't
used it yet, but it's cheaper than similarly sized Moleskines and looks like 
it's of comparable quality. It doesn't have the accordian pocket at the back though,
which is a bummer. Maybe I'll update this post after I use it for a bit.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/how-to-sleep/508781/">This article about sleep</a>
mentions gelastic seizures, which are more interesting than the actual article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A gelastic seizure, also known as "gelastic epilepsy" is a rare type of seizure 
that involves a sudden burst of energy, usually in the form of laughing or crying.
This syndrome usually occurs for no obvious reason and is uncontrollable. It 
is slightly more common in males than females. The term Gelastic originates from 
the Greek word "Gelos" which means laughter. (Wikipedia)</p>

<h3>12.09.16</h3>
<p>I was reading this <a href="https://theringer.com/the-great-j-cole-debate-31eb37c2a094#.rx6syvt5x">article on theringer.com</a> about whether or not J. Cole is good (his album came out today) 
and there was an interesting thing about the Barnum effect. Shea Serrano
wrote about it pretty well and I'm pretty lazy so I'll just copy his words here.
It's a bit profane cause that's just the thug life so the censors are mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Serrano: Do you know what the Barnum effect is? I learned, like, maybe five 
things in college that stuck with me after I graduated. The Barnum effect is
one of them. The general definition of it is: "The observation that individuals
will give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that
supposedly are tailored specifically for them but are, in fact, vague and
general enough to apply to a wide range of people." It’s the reason that things
like horoscopes work. You read the horoscope, and it’s like, "Don’t ever cross
a Gemini because it’s very hard to earn a Gemini’s trust back once you’ve
broken it," and all the people who are Geminis are like, "Yup. That’s exactly
right. That’s so me." It feels specific, but it’s mostly applicable to anyone.
That is exactly what J. Cole is, and what he does. Take the J. Cole song
"January 28th" as an example. He says: "If you ain’t aim too high / Then you
aim too low." When you hear it while he’s rapping it, you’re like, "OK." But
then you think about it for, like, five seconds, and it’s like, "Wait … what
the eff?" I don’t think he’s actually relatable. I think he’s a familiar
version of relatable, which people confuse with the real thing. 5/20. ("You the
shiz only ’cause I digested you nignogs" — J. Cole, "See It to Believe It")</p>

<p>My friend kshit explained the surprise exam paradox yesterday, which is 
summarized as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexpected_hanging_paradox">unexpected hanging paradox</a>
on Wikipedia. I'll try to explain it here.</p>
<p>So you're taking high school chemistry, and your teacher tells you that you have 
a surprise test next week. She tells you that it will either be on Monday,
Wednesday, or Friday. However, you realize that none of these days can be 
a surprise. If the test is on Friday, then by Thursday night, you know 
the test will be on Friday. So the test cannot be on Friday. Similarly, if 
the test is on Wednesday, then by Tuesday night, you know the test will be
on Wednesday, since it did not happen on Monday and cannot happen on Friday.
The same logic applies to Monday. So you stride confidently into the week,
knowing that there can be no suprise test. The test then happens on Monday
and takes you by total surprise.</p>
<p>One (perhaps naive) explanation is that this is a second order surprise. The
teacher surprises you, the student, by defying your expectations. For example,
you assume that the teacher will not have the test on Friday, because then 
it would not be a surprise. But then, in order to surprise you, the teacher
can put it on Friday. In that case, you wouldn't be surprised that the test 
happened, but surprised that the test happened to happen (on Friday). Hopefully
that makes some amount of sense. If not go ask kshit to explain it to you.</p>
<h3>12.06.16</h3>
<p>I saw a TIL on Reddit today titled "TIL Stephen Colbert once took over a public
access cable show in Michigan to interview Eminem on the air." So basically,
it was someone posting a cool interview under the pretext of a TIL. I've
decided to do the same thing here because <a href="https://youtu.be/PniJM5IwXfE?t">the video</a> is just that phenomenal - not 
just the Eminem part, but the entire thing.</p>
<h3>12.05.16</h3>
<p>Grandmaster Flash invented the thing where you move the vinyl with your hand.
You know, to fastforward or rewind or loop a part over and over when you're 
DJing. Before people would just move the tonearm, which was really imprecise.
But then Grandmaster Flash was just like... I'm gonna touch the vinyl, even
though it was taboo at the time. Got this tidbit from the Nextflix original
Hip-Hop Evolution ep. 1, which is hosted by Shad(!).</p>
<h3>12.04.16</h3>
<p>It's finals week so these might get kind of boring, if that changes anything.
Modest Mouse has a song called "Sleepwalking" aka "Sleekwalkin'" aka 
"Sleepwalking (Couples Only Dance Prom Night)" which appears on their <em>Interstate 8</em>
EP and their <em>Building Nothing Out of Something</em> compilation album. I never thought
about it before now, but that latter album name makes a lot of sense. Anyways,
the intro is a "cover" or adaptation of the similarly named "Sleepwalk" by 
Santo &amp; Johnny, a song from the 1950s that gets its memorable melody from a steel
guitar. More specifically, the sad little melody at the beginning of "Sleepwalking"
is basically exactly the same as the introductory steel guitar part in "Sleepwalk."
The loop that gets played through "Sleepwalking" also sounds kinda similar to the
bassline in "Sleepwalk," but it's not exactly the same. </p>
<h3>12.02.16</h3>
<p>Donald Glover's third studio album, "Awaken, My Love!", came out today. Apparently
he does all the vocals, which is pretty impressive considering the variation. 
I'm not entirely sure how to check this; he doesn't list any collaborators,
but I'm pretty sure (aka not really sure) you can just sample some random vocal 
track, or get a random friend to do some vocals and not credit them on the album. </p>
<h3>12.01.16</h3>
<p>An interesting bit from Susan Sontag's <em>Regarding the Pain of Others</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something becomes real - to those who are elsewhere, following it as "news" - 
by being photographed. But a catastrophe that is experienced will often seem eerily
like its representation. The attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001,
was described as "unreal," "surreal," "like a movie," in many of the first 
accounts of those who escaped from the towers or watched from nearby. (After 
four decades of big-budget Hollywood disaster films, "It felt like a movie" 
seems to have displaced the way survivors of a catastrophe used to express the 
short-term unassimilability of what they had gone through: "It felt like a dream.") (22 - 23)</p>

<h3>11.30.16</h3>
<p>If you don't properly heat shirts after screening them, the whole design 
might come off in the wash as one big layer of paint. Like, the whole thing will
just peel off like an orange or something. Jim the art teacher informed us of this
after we turned down the heat conveyer belt because it was slightly burning our 
shirts. He told us to just make it faster. He also said something about the heat
making the paint bond with the shirt instead of just laying on top of it (which
is why it would peel off).</p>

<p>Yellow Magic Orchestra was the first band to use the TR-808. 
They were also one of the earliest, if not the earliest, to use it in a live
performance when they performed their song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT3W6Zl8bx4&amp;index=1&amp;list=RDTT3W6Zl8bx4">"1000 Knives."</a>. This is an electro-cover of Ryuichi Sakamoto's piano song

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/11/plight-of-the-funny-female/416559/">This article</a>
about men not liking funny women is is pretty interesting. The three 
main points I got from it are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Men try harder to be funny (make more jokes) which makes them
be perceived as funnier.</li>
<li>"Women want men who will tell jokes; men want women who will laugh at theirs."</li>
<li>Men can be turned off by a funny female. The experiment for this 
sounds kind of weird though, so I'm not extremely sold on the evidence. 
Indifference would make more sense to me.</li>

<p>Fluxx is a game. It's hard to explain how to play, so you should just play it.
Just to give a little sense of how little sense it makes, it works a little like this.
The game starts with one basic rule: draw one card, play one card. Everyone
starts with a hand of three, and on their turn they follow the basic rule.
As the game progresses, new rules (type of card) and goals (type of card) 
will be played, changing how the game is played and won. For example, a rule 
might be "Play 3 cards each turn", or "Draw 3 cards each turn," and a goal might 
be "You win if you have a sandwich and a friend." Stuff like that. </p>
<p>A few more details - the game is supposed to take 5-30 minutes to play, and 
is supposed to to be played with 2-6 players. It usually takes longer the more 
players are involved; the goals change more frequently against each player,
the keepers (good for winning, you'll get it if you play) are distributed more 
widely, and there are just more turns to be played out. That being said, there's 
not really a strategy to this game. It's so random and chaotic that any plans
you may have often get destroyed as soon as you start making them. That's what
makes it fun! Also, if you play with 7 players, it might take forever and annoy
everyone (depending on who everyone is). Perhaps this game actually was playtested.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.setgame.com/set/puzzle">Set the Game</a> is a thing. I had totally
forgotten this existed. It's a card game where you look for patterns. You can
also play online. The same company makes Quiddler which is also pretty fun. 
But anyways, I'll briefly explain Set. The game is played by laying 12 cards 
out in a 3 x 4 grid. There are 3 different shapes, 3 different colors, 3
different shading patterns, and 3 different numbers (for a total of 81 cards, meaning
each card is unique). For example, one card consists of a single-green-solid-squiggly
(number-color-shading-shape). The goal is to look for triples 
where each characteristic is completely the same or completely different. 
For example, three cards that are all green but have three different shapes might
be a valid triple. Whoever has the most cards at the ends wins. I played this game at 
kath's house and lost very closely (out of practice).</p>

<p>A profile of Leo Tolstoy that I copied from my copy of <em>War and Peace</em> (Penguin,
Anthony Briggs):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leo Tolstoy was born in central Russia in 1828. He studied Oriental languages 
and law (though failed to earn a degree in the latter) at the University of Kazan,
and after a dissolute youth eventually joined an artillery regiment in the Caucasus 
in 1852. He took part in the Crimean War, and the <em>Sebastopol Sketches</em> that emerged from 
it established his reputation. After living for some time in St Petersburg and abroad, 
he married Sofya Behrs in 1862 and they had thirteen children. The happiness this 
brought gave him the creative impulse for his two greatest novels, <em>War and Peace</em> 
(1869) and <em>Anna Karenina</em> (1877). Later in life his views became increasingly radical
as he gave up his possessions in order to live a simple peasant life. After a quarrel 
with his wife he fled home secretly one night to seek refuge in a monastery. He 
became ill during this dramatic flight and died at the small railway station of 
Astapovo in 1910.</p>

his morning alarm (a college radio station from the University of Western Ontario)
and heard one of their songs playing. He got really into them; he liked their 
"funny and violent and moody and dark" lyrics, and found it cool that they were 
only a bit older than him (still in high school at the time). He went to their
concert, and even got to hang out with the band a bit beforehand. Unfortunately,
his sister and her friend were only ~16, so they had to leave early. He apparently
still remembers the "searing guitar from the song 'Scott Pilgrim' blasting out the door"
as they left. And that's the song that inspired the graphic novels.</p>

<p>Michael Voltaggio is an American chef who currently lives in LA. He's 
semi-famous because he won the sixth season of <em>Top Chef</em>. The head judge
of <em>Top Chef</em> has said: "Out of all the cooks that have come through the show, 
Michael is the most talented - both from a sensibility and technical standpoint.
He has the chops to pull of what he's trying to do." MV has a two restaurants:
ink.sack, which makes small, cheap, "artisanal" (unusual) sandwiches, and ink,
which is a fancier "modern Los Angeles" restaurant right next to ink (like two
doors down). Here's the current menu for ink, which changes frequently.
<img alt="image" src="/images/ink_menu.png" />
Note that they also have dessert, which is really good. I guess the dessert menu
is secret, because it's not listed on their website. The service at ink is great.
The food came quickly, and the server always prefaced the dish
with a quick description that went over our heads but sounded good and 
fancy. We were probably served by around 5 different people throughout the 
dinner. They recommended sharing and ordering all the dishes at once; I forget 
what the reason was but I'm sure it's easier for them. There might be something about them ordering
the dishes in a certain way, although if you order a lot this probably
goes out the window. Anyways, we ordered 5 appetizers (1), 2 entrees (2),
5 sides (+), and 4 desserts (all of them). The delineation between appetizers
and entrees is kind of nonexistent. To get a complete meal, you need stuff 
from both (1) and (2). (2) is more accurately classified as meatstuffs. 
Anyways, one more interesting thing: apparently the hundreds (clothing company)
did a collaboration with voltaggio on a tee called the "sack adam."</p>

<p>A theophany is the appearance of a deity to a human. A famous example would
be God appearing to Moses as a burning bush. Another good example (not sure 
how famous this is) pops up in the poem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_(poem)"><em>Andreas</em></a>,
in which God disguises himself as a sailor. Under this guise, he captains a
boat for Andrew, and asks him a bunch of questions about Christianity and 
God and things of that nature.</p>

<p>TIL of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9r45O1eXtQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">water spouting</a>.
It was made famous by this guy called Hadji Ali in his "human flamethrower" act.
For this act, he would drink a bunch of water followed by a bunch of kerosene.
He would then forcefully regurgitate the kerosene ("spout" it) to incite large
flames. Finally, he would put the flames out by spouting the water. David Blaine
learned this trick from a guy in Africa, and now uses it in some of his acts (see
the video linked above). Here's an <a href="https://streamable.com/60n3">amazing gif</a>
that may or may not demonstrate the trick (it might just be sleight of hand or 
something). It also has Steph Curry, Drake, and Dave Chappelle in it which is cool.</p>

<p>Some vi/vim things:</p>
<ul>
<li>vi is pronounced vee-I but no one actually pronounces it like that.</li>
<li>vi was created by Bill Joy, who (of lesser importance) co-founded Sun Microsystems.</li>
<li>vi was originally written as the visual mode for a line editor called ex.</li>
<li>vi gets its name by abbreviating visual. Put into slightly more confusing but
more technically correct language, it gets its name from "the shortest 
unambiguous abbreviation for the ex command <code>visual</code>, which switches the ex 
line editor to visual mode." ex is the line editor mentioned above.</li>
<li>vim = vi improved.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">Wikipedia page for vi</a>, from which I stole
basically all this information, is very interesting. You should read it. And then
vim it. Don't geddit. Get it? Haha. I stole that joke from victor if he ever reads this.</p>

<p>Apparently Mike Will Made-It made the beat for Black Beatles in 10 minutes. Not

<p>Also, since that source is pretty unreliable, here's something that's actually 
a thing. Bibliotherapy is, according to the <em>Online Dictionary for Library and
Information Science</em>, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of books selected on the basis of content in a planned reading program designed to facilitate the recovery of patients suffering from mental illness or emotional disturbance. Ideally, the process occurs in three phases: personal identification of the reader with a particular character in the recommended work, resulting in psychological catharsis, which leads to rational insight concerning the relevance of the solution suggested in the text to the reader's own experience. Assistance of a trained psychotherapist is advised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a more basic sense, bibliotherapy is the use of books to help someone solve 
their personal issues. The term was coined in 1916 by Samuel Crothers in an Atlantic
Monthly article, but the practice/idea has been around for much longer. The oldest 
known library motto in the world is "the house of healing for the soul", and 
Marcus Aurelius's physician maintained a medicical library in the first century A.D.
Was informed of this term by Kath (thanks ). </p>

<p>Boss Monster is a cool dungeon building card game. The goal of the game is to
build up a strong dungeon that attracts and kills heroes (so a bit of a paradigm
shift from the classic RPG). Each turn, you draw a "room" card which can be used
to add to your dungeon. Then, a few heros are drawn. Heros are distributed to
dungeons based on certain characteristics of the dungeons. If your dungeon kills 
a hero, you get a point (first to 10 wins). Otherwise, you get wounded (5 wounds
and you lose). There are a bunch of other intricacies involving spell cards and 
room types/effects and whatnot; suffice it to say that the game gets suprisingly 
(but not overly) strategic as the dungeons start to grow. Lastly, can't forget
the awesome card designs - classic 8bit RPG goodness. Learned about this game 
from Simon the Hag, and got it from Matt (thanks ~).</p>

<p>You can get awesome hand-crafted metal posters from <a href="https://displate.com/">displate.com</a>.
They're super easy to hang because they come with an adhesive magnet. You can
stick the magnet to the wall, and then attach the poster to the magnet, which
allows for easy-repositioning of the poster. Apparently they have over 1,000 artists
and 40,000 designs. They also plant 10 trees for each purchased Displate.

<p>The title of the African novel <em>Things Fall Apart</em> is taken from the opening 
lines of W.B. Yeat's poem <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43290">"The Second Coming"</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Turning and turning in the widening gyre</em><br />
<em>The falcon cannot hear the falconer;</em><br />
<em>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;</em><br />
<em>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world...</em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tangentially, here's a passage I liked from the novel. It's prefaced by Uchendu
putting Okonkwo's problems into context by telling him of even greater problems,
some of them personal. He ends his schpeal by asking if Okonkwo has heard "the song
they sing when a woman dies", which goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For whom is it well, for whom is it well?</em><br />
<em>There is no one for whom it is well.</em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This stuff is on page 135 (in my version).</p>

<p>Gustave Flaubert worked on a few books before the famous <em>Madame Bovary</em>. 
Included amongst these was the first version of <em>The Temptation of Saint
Anthony</em>. He read the novel out loud to two friends over four days, and told 
them to keep down any interruptions or opinions during that time. At the end
of the reading, his friends told him to throw the manuscript in the fire, and 
suggested that he write about day-to-day life instead of more fantastical subjects.</p>

<p>Cotton swabs were invented in the 1920s by this guy named Leo Gerstenzang. He

this to <em>Q-Tips Baby Gays</em> (Q for quality), which then got shortened again to just

<p>Ok, this tip is actually legit. I think I learned this a while ago and I forgot,
which I shouldn't have, because it's really important. You know those window 
blinds, the ones made of a bunch of thin rectangles strung together than can
be rotated to block/not-block light? And then you can also just raise the whole
thing with a pull string? If you want to get the blinds to actually stay up,
you pull the string, and then when you release it, make sure the string is 
perfectly straight. That is, make sure your hand, or whatever you're pulling
it with, is directly below where the string starts. If you want it to come 
down, just pull the string and then give it slack when it's diagonal, or sideways,
or something like that.</p>

<p>In the original Old Testament (I think), Cain's sacrifice was put forward with 
less good will than Abel's: "Abel, a generous shepherd, offered the fattest of 
his sheep as an oblation to God. But Cain, a miserly farmer, offered only a 
bunch of grass and some worthless seeds to him" (Wikipedia). However, in
the Old Testament Narratives (Old English Poems which I'm actually reading
for class), this detail is omitted. The entire recounting is quite sparse; 
if I didn't know it was so important, I wouldn't think it was so important.</p>
<h3>10.24.16</h3>
<p><em>Sic transit gloria mundi</em> - thus passes the glory of the world. Another
interpretation: worldly things are fleeting. It appears many times 
in pop culture (see Wikipedia), and used to be used in the ritual of 
"papal coronation ceremonies" (crowning the pope). The phrase can also be used
in reference to the stafflike instrument used in such ceremonies. </p>
<p>There's also a really nice <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/best-poems/emily-dickinson/sic-transit-gloria-mundi/">Emily Dickinson poem</a>

<p>Chronic nosebleeds can be treated in a variety of ways. Cauterization seems 
to be a common one, in which a stick of silver nitrate is stuck up 
the nose and used to "burn the ends of all the blood vessels". Nasal packing,
or the "application of sterile tampons to the nasal chambers", is another method.
Finally, if neither of these methods succeed, surgery may be necessary. The
patient is examined under general anesthesia and some type of surgical work on the 
nose's blood vessels is performed to stem the bleeding.</p>

<p>Two kinda interesting things this morning. First, Post-it TM notes are 
bad for books (so are similar brands of sticky notes). They <a href="http://www.library.illinois.edu/prescons/services/education_training/stickynotes.html">leave behind 
a residue</a>
which attracts dirt, makes pages stick together, or smears text,
even if notes are immediately removed. This isn't just anecdotal evidence:
the <em>National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)</em> conducted a study
on this stuff. Further, some notes are made of poor quality paper, which 
can cause damage over time. Even further, some notes (not THE Post-it TM note)
use <a href="http://siarchives.si.edu/blog/post-it-or-not-post-it">poor quality adhesive</a> 
(butyrate) that discolors paper over time. Basically,
this is actually kind of complicaed, and simply put, sticky notes are bad
for books.</p>
<p>Also this stackoverflow post about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/273192/how-to-check-if-a-directory-exists-and-create-it-if-necessary">how to check if a directory exists and create
it if necessary?</a>
is quite good. It's a very simple question and then stuff starts to hit the 
fan when blanket-catching <code>OSError</code>s as a workaround to a race condition doesn't
work, etc. etc. </p>
<p>Note:<br />
I think the poor quality paper thing is probably lignin paper. Apparently

<p>The <em>Psychomachia</em> is a poem by Prudentius written in the fifth century AD.
It's said to be the first and most influential "pure" medieval allegory. 
The plot is pretty simple. There are some personified virtues (e.g. Hope, Sobriety,
Faith, etc.), and some personified vices (Pride, Anger, Avarice, etc.). All
the personifications are women, due to Latin word genders. The virtues and 
vices duke it out one-on-one, with the virtues ultimately succeeding. Along 
the way there are some Mortal Combat style fatalities, monologues about 
stuff, etc. Psychomachia can also be used as a regular word to mean 
"conflict within the soul", although it appears this is rare.</p>

<p>Found this <a href="http://www.treblezine.com/out-of-the-bungalow-bon-iver-interview/">interesting interview</a>
of Bon Iver. Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>For Emma, Forever Ago</em> was recorded at Justin's "little bungalow house in Eau Claire, Wisconsin."
However, he didn't go there for the purpose of recording an album. According to him,
he went there "out of necessity." Some background: during the summer of 2006, he 
was dealing with mono and pneumonia. During this time, he also broke up with his 
band, and subsequently broke up with his girlfriend. After he broke up with his
girlfriend, he continued to live with her while he worked on a record for 
The Rosebuds (after he finished working on one of her records, for her band Nola).
He also had a bad liver infection. After he was done with The Rosebuds record,
he toook off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he had everything all mixed, he thought the songs were just demos. But 
after showing them to friends and getting good reactions, everything took off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About the process, he says: "I still, to a certain degree, will be insecure 
always, but I think that I’ll continue to make records like this. I’m not going 
to hire engineers; I’m not going to hire producers. I’m fully capable of doing 
all that stuff, and I’m just going to keep it within myself, under my control 
and surveillance."</p>

<p>A super beginner's guide to silk painting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stretch silk onto some kind of apparatus. One kind of apparatus involves
rubber-banding a bunch of three-pronged forks around a wooden frame. The forks
then pierce the silk, and are used to suspend the silk in the center of the 
frame. The shiny side should be facing upwards (this is the side you paint on).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply gutta, which is a "resist." Basically, it's a gluelike substance that
prevents dye from reaching the silk, and can be used to guide the dye into 
cool patterns. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let the gutta dry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wet the entire shebang (with water). You can use a spray bottle, or run 
it under a shower, or otherwise cover the fabric with water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get some paint brushes and dyes, and start painting. If you're using strong
dyes, you might want to dilute them with water. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steam the thing. This binds the dye and the fabric together. I think you can
repeat the entire process with the dried fabric, but I haven't actually tried 
it. Don't see a reason why you couldn't.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you can also wet it and then apply the gutta. It's not recommended but
it might do something cool (not sure, didn't try). You can also just skip

<p>The coupon collector's problem goes as follows. There is a jar with <em>N</em> unique
coupons. You are a collector. Each turn, you draw one coupon from the jar; after
you draw it, you put it back. Each coupon is equally likely to be drawn. 
What is the probability that more than <em>T</em> turns are needed to collect all 
<em>N</em> coupons? Upon analysis, it can be found that the expected number of turns <em>T</em>
is <em>O(n</em> log<em>n)</em>. For example, if there are <em>N = 50</em> coupons, it takes, on average,
<em>225</em> turns to collect all the coupons.</p>

<p>One pair of twins both suffered crippling migraines, owned dogs that they had named Toy, married women named Linda, and had sons named James Allan (although one spelled the middle name with a single “l”). Another pair—one brought up Jewish, in Trinidad, and the other Catholic, in Nazi Germany, where he joined the Hitler Youth—wore blue shirts with epaulets and four pockets, and shared peculiar obsessive behaviors, such as flushing the toilet before using it. Both had invented fake sneezes to diffuse tense moments. Two sisters—separated long before the development of language—had invented the same word to describe the way they scrunched up their noses: “squidging.” Another pair confessed that they had been haunted by nightmares of being suffocated by various metallic objects—doorknobs, fishhooks, and the like.</p>

<p>Anne Sexton was a confessional poet, a bit like Sylvia Plath both as a 
person (perhaps a generalization, but note that they bonded over their shared
madness) and as a poet. Similarly to Plath, Anne battled depression and committed 
suicide at an early age. There was a part of her that always wanted more: more 
awards and accolades and affirmation. For a short period of her life, she 
performed in her very own band called Anne Sexton &amp; Her Kind. They experimented
with a variety of musical styles - bebop and jazz and country and folk - with
Anne Sexton providing the vocals. None of the songs are sung. Instead, they're 
rhythmically read, in a way that differs from what one would expect from a 
typical poetry reading. If you do want to hear Anne sing, her voice is

<p>But to avoid making this a dictionary, here's something else that might be of 
slight interest. Devil tumors are <em>transmissible</em> tumors. They were first observed 
on Tasmanian devils - researchers noticed tumors on these suffering creatures 
were genetically identical, and realized that the cancer was jumping from one 
devil to another. In simple terms, these animals transmitted the cancer by biting 
each other on the face (a fairly regular behavior for them), an area which could 
contain cancerous tumors. As Tasmanian devils tend to inbreed, leading to 
relatively low genetic diversity, the tumors spread via this mechanism (as 
opposed to being killed when transferred to a foreign host).</p>

<p>FILD, which stands for Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming, is a technique that utilizes
finger movement in an attempt to induce lucid dreams. The overall idea is 
as follows. Go to sleep. Wake up ~6hrs later (should probably be in the 
middle of REM?). As you're going back to sleep, which should be very easy,
perform an up-down motion with the index and middle fingers of one hand. That
is, alternatively press the index finger down (with the middle finger up), and 
then the middle finger down (lifting the index finger up), mimicking the motion
used to repeatedly play two notes on a piano. Do this motion lightly, and focus
on it while going to sleep. The author of the thread says to perform a reality
check ~20 seconds after starting the finger movements; specifically, to pinch
the nose and try breathing in. I haven't yet tried this for fear of suffocating
but perhaps it is effective.</p>

<p>Copying large portions of these words from my friend Katherine because
I am lazy, ...
There are two major ways of looking at the meaning of words. The first 
is the referentialist method, and the second is the internalist. According 
to referentialists, words directly reference real objects. For 
example, if someone is talking about a desk, a referentialist would say 
they are "referencing" an actual desk in real life. On the other hand, 
according to internalists, words refer to internal concepts. With this
interpretation, the concept of a desk may vary between different people.</p>
<p>Referentialists run into a problem when talking about fantastical characters
like Santa Claus. The sentence "Santa Claus treats his reindeers rather 
poorly" makes sense, but from a referentialist standpoint, Santa Claus
should be referring to an actual, existing thing. In order to fix this
problem, referentialists say that Santa Claus does exist, but as an
abstract object (as opposed to a concrete one).</p>

<p>Portlanders sometimes refer to Portland (usually in text) as pdx. This abbreviation
also refers to Portland's airport. It's analagous to calling Los Angeles lax, or 
San Francisco sfo. I saw this used in various books, zines, and bumper stickers,
and confirmed its usage with my airbnb host, Heidi.</p>
<h3>03.19.16</h3>
<p>According to the "Zinester's Guide to Portland (5th Ed.)" and Wikipedia, 
Powell's City of Books is the largest independent bookstore in the world.
They sure do have a lot of Sylvia Plath books.</p>
<h3>03.18.16</h3>
<p>The FDA "alcohol line" stands at 0.5%. That is, any beverage whose alcoholic
contents exceed that percentage are marked as booze.</p>
<h3>03.16.16</h3>
<p>Amsterdam is known for its tulips, amongst other things.</p>
<h3>03.14.16</h3>
<p>Steph Curry's birthday is Pi day. Steph Curry's birthday is today. Today is
Pi day. Sadly, I ate no pie.</p>
<h3>03.13.16</h3>
<p>Was busy spending quality time with Pintos today so I kind of cheated and just
found this while browsing the front page of Reddit: 
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-doughnut-unofficial-national-sugary-snack">There are more doughnut shops per capita in Canada than anywhere else on the planet</a>.</p>
<h3>03.12.16</h3>
<p>The income tax was first thought of in 1812 (war with England), adopted in 
1861 (Civil War), adopted again in 1894 (Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act), and finalized
with the 16th amendment.</p>
<h3>03.11.16</h3>
<p>"Google recommends LuminPDF as its third-party provider for seamless PDF editing."
Basically, you can open PDFs stored in Google Drive in the LuminPDF app, and then
mark them up (highlight, underline, strikethrough, insert text, etc.). I couldn't
actually figure out how to save the edited PDF back to drive, but I'm sure it's
possible.</p>
<h3>03.10.16</h3>
<p>In C, a static variable inside a function is locally scoped, but is changed on 
a "global" level. For example, say we have the function</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>void foo(void) {
    static int x = 0;
    x++;
    printf(&quot;x = %d\n&quot;, x);
}

int main(void) {
    foo(); // prints &#39;x = 1&#39;
    foo(); // prints &#39;x = 2&#39;
    foo(); // prints &#39;x = 3&#39;
    foo(); // prints &#39;x = 4&#39;
    foo(); // prints &#39;x = 5&#39;        
}
</pre></div>


<p>This is neat. Note that static variables aren't stored on the stack or heap, 
but instead are kept somewhere on the data segment or BSS segment (depending 
whether the data is initialized).</p>
<h3>03.09.16</h3>
<p>AlphaGo (AI developed by Google's DeepMind team) beat the legendary Go player
Lee Se-dol, a seemingly big step forward for the field. Compare this to 
Facebook's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkforest">darkforest</a>...</p>
<h3>03.08.16</h3>
<p>The hard problem of consciousness can be phrased in the following way: "why do
qualia exist?" In other words, what accounts for the unique sensation of color
that people experience upon viewing the same night sky? This problem stands
in contrast to easy problems, which can be explained via mechanisms.</p>
<h3>03.07.16</h3>
<p>The supremum is the least upper bound. Maybe if I type this down I'll actually
remember it.</p>
<h3>03.06.16</h3>
<p>A zine containing Wikipedia lists (and lists of lists, and lists of lists
of lists, etc.) informed me of Sweden's Donald Duck Party - a joke party that
has been receiving joke/protests votes for years. At its peak, it was the 
9th most popular party.</p>
<h3>03.02.16</h3>
<p>Boba was invented in Taiwan. I feel like I might have known this already?</p>
<h3>03.01.16</h3>
<p>The psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott invented the concepts of "True Self"
and "False Self". "True Self" is the sense of self that comes from
"authentic experience", and a feeling of being alive. "False Self" is a facade -
the sense of self that arises when one, perhaps, is not completely comfortable 
and puts on an overthought front. </p>
<h3>02.29.16</h3>
<p>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas managed to go ten years without speaking
during "oral arguments." He broke the streak by asking a question. This led
to the fantastic headline, <strong>Justice Clarence Thomas breaks 10-year streak, 
asks question in court</strong>.</p>
<h3>02.28.16</h3>
<p>Otto Plath was a really interesting guy. He "detested stock responses", 
and used to skin, cook, and eat a rat during his college classes. The so-called
"Bee-King", he used to follow bees to their nesting place and suck the honey
from the hive with a long straw. He had a seemingly mystical power over
bees; they never stung him when he caught them, and he once caught a bee in his fist
and held it to his young daughter's ear.</p>
<h3>02.26.16</h3>
<p>Kafka never finished <em>The Castle</em>.</p>
<h3>02.25.16</h3>
<p>Did you know that nose whistles exist?</p>
<h3>02.24.16</h3>
<p>"I Wandered Lonley as a Cloud" is a happy poem by William Woodsworth (thanks
Katherine).</p>
<h3>02.23.16</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/06/russia.mcdonalds">McDonald's theory of war</a>,
which isn't actually true, posits that countries with McDonald's don't go to
war with each other.</p>
<h3>02.22.16</h3>
<p>HeLa is immortal! It also came about from a bunch of random factors (not all
cancer cells grow in culture). Bioethics is interesting.</p>
<h3>02.21.16</h3>
<p>My old math prof, Matilde Marcolli, does art. I didn't see it, but my roommmate
described it as "watercolor over math notes" - he saw her work on display at
Century books. I heard there are some matrix rotations in there. </p>
<h3>02.20.16</h3>
<p>People in Romania say "house of stone" when people get married. Roughly,
it means "good luck and strong marriage." </p>
<h3>02.19.16</h3>
<p>Emily Dickinson wrote about 1500 poems. Of these, around 10 were published
during her lifetime.</p>
<h3>02.18.16</h3>
<p>My CS144 set had a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_game">pirate game</a>
on it, which is a cool game-theory type brain teaser. </p>
<h3>02.17.16</h3>
<p>A study was done that found drunk people are more likely to push the
fat man (or route the trolley).</p>
<h3>02.16.16</h3>
<p>Ben &amp; Jerry's is 5-10 times more expensive as some other ice creams (Lucerne, 
Dreyer's, those other cheap ones). Per-X prices are handy.</p>
<h3>02.15.16</h3>
<p>After iterating through three Keegan facts, here's what popped out:
Kanye West and Kanye North are 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_constituencies_of_Botswana">parliamentary constituents of Botswana</a>.</p>
<h3>02.14.16</h3>
<p>Pointer arithmetic on a <code>void *</code> is illegal in C and C++, but GCC allows it 
(increments/decrements happen in byte size chunks). </p>
<h3>02.13.16</h3>
<p>Apparently, you can bike from Manhattan Beach to Manhattan Beach in about a month.</p>
<h3>02.12.16</h3>
<p>There's a synthesizer called Synplant where you plant seeds that grow into
synth patches; kind of like an organic, less numerical approach to sound. Found out
about it in this <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/S9esf/">Grimes interview</a>.</p>
<h3>02.11.16</h3>
<p>I feel like it would be better if the information intake in my life were a little
more evenly distributed. It turns out that gravitational waves exist. Thanks
LIGO &amp; Caltech &amp; smart people. Also, 99% of all households purchase milk (source:
my friend Matt: source: random milk facts website).</p>
<h3>02.10.16</h3>
<p>Adolf Eichmann dabbled massively in the logistics of killing Jews. Another one
from <em>Kafka</em>.</p>
<h3>02.09.16</h3>
<p>A bildungsroman is "a novel dealing with one person's formative years or spiritual 
education." I came across this term in <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>, a book (quite good
and weird so far) which uses it fairly frequently.</p>
<h3>02.08.16</h3>
<p>The Linux kernel switches schedulers a lot. The default scheduler right now
is the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). There's also a scheduler, created 
as an alternative to the CFS, called the Brain F Scheduler (BFS). I feel like
profane names prophecy the inevitable non-mainstreamity of the namee, although
I guess the name could always be changed.</p>
<h3>02.07.16</h3>
<p>Indigo children supposedly possess special powers like talking to dead people and/or
God. They're named after the blue aura which supposedly surrounds them. I suppose
they could supposedly exist.</p>
<h3>02.06.16</h3>
<p>You can use Pyenv to switch between Python versions!</p>
<h3>02.05.16</h3>
<p>Victor, one of my housemates, got sick today. It might be norovirus, which 
is apparently highly contagious and can be transferred by eating someone's 
stool. </p>
<h3>02.04.16</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>All good things must come to an end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The origin of this optimism? <em>Troilus and Criseyde</em>, a rollicking romance set 
during the Siege of Troy. I Wikipedia'd the story today for no particular reason 
(I read it last term for En121). Also, Criseyde is prounounced Chris-Aye-Duh. Or 
at least that's the way it sounds nice to my ears.</p>
<h3>02.03.16</h3>
<p>Whilst writing a political science paper for some fun school stuff, I happened
across the following lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the discretion of the commander, soldiers were authorized one pint per day 
[of beer] in garrison, and two pints per day in the field. Fresh ingredients in 
the beer were thought to offset the likelihood of scurvy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Images of melted-down Ben &amp; Jerry's pints (with alcohol replacing swirled dairy) 
come to mind. This stuff was found in <em>Redcoat Resupply!</em> by Major Tokar.</p>
<h3>02.02.16</h3>
<p>I (re)learned about a famous study that found guys are more likely to call an
attractive woman if they're scared of dying (fatal attraction?). They called 
it "Some Evidence for Heightened Sexual Attraction Under Conditions of High 
Anxiety." I read about it in Aziz's book. I also found out you can set 
conditional breakpoints in GDB; kinda wish I had known that a bit earlier.</p>
<h3>02.01.16</h3>
<p>After a few mishearings (Pareto? frontal? prandial?), my friend Bogdan 
(with his Romanian accent) conveyed to me the existence of the Prandtl number. 
It's not very exciting.</p>
<h3>01.31.16</h3>
<p>I was informed about "the most infamous rhyme" in Middle English, which
appears in Chaucer's <em>The Canterbury Tales</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queynte;<br />
And prively he caughte hire by the queynte,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My friend Sid, courtesy of Jennifer Jahner (a Caltech prof), told me this
chivalrous tidbit. </p>
<h3>01.30.16</h3>
<p>My friend Sihui sent me a picture of congee, which is rice porridge.
I'd only known it as jook before. Turns out congee is the more general
term for the dish.</p>
